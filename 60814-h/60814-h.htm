appeal. As argument, it reveals that
Bohemian character, citing the place
of Bohemia in the art of citizenship,
in the power of self-control, in its national
ideals, in its policies of accommodation
to the plans of neighboring
states, in its contribution to the world
of creative arts, and in its personal
views of national duty and responsibility.
As appeal it enumerates, point
by point, the injustice of many years
of Hapsburg rule, and sets out in
clear light the many reasons why the
Bohemians deserve freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a id="NOTE_ON_BOHEMIAN_PRONUNCIATION">NOTE ON BOHEMIAN PRONUNCIATION</a></h2>

<p>A noted authority has said that &ldquo;no other modern
language can translate the ancient classics so readily,
and yet so completely and forcibly as the Bohemian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bohemian is the most developed of the Slavic
tongues. Consistently a phonetic tongue, it is pronounced
as it is written.</p>

<p>The vowels are pronounced as in Italian.</p>

<p>Invariably the accent falls on the first syllable, irrespective
of the length of the word.</p>

<p>Before Hus&rsquo;s time Bohemian orthography resembled
somewhat that of the present day Polish. By introducing
the diacritic mark, the reformer did away
with groups of consonants such as cs, cz.</p>

<p>The diacritic mark occurs on the following letters:
&aacute;, &eacute;, &#269;, &#271;, &iacute;, &#328;, &#345;, &#353;, &#357;, &uacute;, &#367;, &yacute;, &#382;. &#270; and &oacute; are used least
of all. The mark tends alike to soften and shade the
sound of the letter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>&aacute; is pronounced long as in darling.</li>
  <li>&eacute; as a in care.</li>
  <li>&#283; as ye in yellow.</li>
  <li>&#269; as ch in cherry.</li>
  <li>&iacute; and &yacute; as ee in tree.</li>
  <li>&#328; as &ntilde; in ca&ntilde;on.</li>
  <li>&#345; is thought to be unpronounceable by a non-Bohemian.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">-&nbsp;10&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans taunt the Bohemians with the &#345;. The rsh
in Pershing approaches the sound though it does not
quite express it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>&#353; as sh in shall.</li>
  <li>&uacute; and &#367; long as in rule.</li>
  <li>&#382; as in j in the French word jour.</li>
  <li>ch as in the Scottish loch.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">-&nbsp;11&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY</a></h2>

<p>It sounds incredible, yet it is literally true, that every
Slavic nation was, before the war, and probably still is,
better known to the English speaking people than the
Bohemians (&#268;echs). What is the reason? That the
Bohemians, who are the most literate of all the Slavs,
have remained undiscovered may be attributed to three
main causes: They are not a free nation. They are a
landlocked nation. They are rated a small nation.</p>

<p>The opportunities which a seacoast offers to a people,
to mention the Dutch, Irish, Belgians, Norwegians,
Swedes and Danes, all of whom are numerically
smaller than the Bohemian-Slovaks are inestimable.
In the forum of world&rsquo;s commerce and politics, the sea
is their powerful sponsor. To a landlocked people this
great boon is denied. Inland nations may reach the
outside world through an intermediary only, and if
that intermediary happens to be a powerful and ungenerous
state, the policy of which is to keep its little
neighbor in the background, the consequences are obvious.</p>

<p>That there live in Central Europe Teutons and none
others but Teutons was being daily demonstrated to the
Americans by a most convincing proof. Almost every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">-&nbsp;12&nbsp;-</a></span>
box of merchandise shipped here from that part of the
world bore the tell-tale mark &ldquo;Made in Germany.&rdquo;
Rarely one saw at the terminals goods labelled &ldquo;Made
in Austria,&rdquo; and rarer still, &ldquo;Made in Bohemia.&rdquo; And
yet many an article of merchandise thus marked was
really made in Bohemia, for parts of Bohemia teem
with all kinds of wonderful industries.</p>

<p>Because of centuries of political and economic subjection,
the very existence of the nation has been lost
sight of by the Anglo-Saxons. In the interval between
the catastrophal defeat of the Bohemians in 1620 and
1848, the year of revolutionary changes, nothing has
occurred in Bohemia to attract the attention of the
world to the Bohemian nation. The Seven Years&rsquo;
War, and later the Napoleonic Wars, were events that
concerned not Bohemia as an independent state, but
the whole of the Hapsburg Empire. The Russians
acquired renown in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century by their defeat of Napoleon. Later, during
the Crimean War, Russia again came into prominence
in the Anglo-American press. Kosciuszko and
Pulaski were names to be conjured with by the Polish
immigrant. The uprisings in 1830 and in 1863 made
sufficiently known to the Americans the ideals and the
miseries of Poland. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877
and the Berlin Congress following it made the English
reader familiar with the geography and political ambitions
of the Balkan Slavs. The Serbs, the Bulgars,
the Montenegrines were successively introduced to the
newspaper man and through him to the public at large.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">-&nbsp;13&nbsp;-</a></span>
Alone the Bohemians remained undiscovered, unknown.</p>

<p>Before the war the average reader did not know
where Bohemia was located with respect to Austria-Hungary.
That ethnically, there might be a difference
between a &#268;ech, Hungarian and an Austrian he
suspected, yet it was not wholly clear to him wherein
the dissimilarity lay. One could cite countless instances
of astonishing naivet&eacute; concerning the history
of the nations which inhabit central and southeastern
Europe. Four years ago a journalist and a writer who
served on the western front in the capacity of a war
correspondent made the astounding discovery that &ldquo;the
ancient Czech (Bohemian) language still continues to
be spoken in Prague.&rdquo; It would no doubt amuse a
Dutchman to read that &ldquo;Dutch is still spoken in
Amsterdam&rdquo;; yet transpose Dutch for Bohemian and
Prague for Amsterdam and the analogy is precise.
When one remembers with what fine scorn an American
looked down upon that corner of Europe, which
in his opinion exhibited altogether too many superfluous
boundary dots, one begins to realize what thankless,
almost futile task it was to talk to him of the
trials, ambitions and triumphs of the Bohemian O&rsquo;Connells,
Emmets, Shelleys, Macauleys and Hallams. With
the rest, the Bohemians had to pay the penalty of being
thought a small nation.</p>

<p>Again there are the Bohemians and bohemians and
how to differentiate between the two is still a puzzle to
a considerable portion of the public. Are all the Bohemians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">-&nbsp;14&nbsp;-</a></span>
artists, who &ldquo;secede from conventionality in life
and art&rdquo;? That even cultured&mdash;let us not hope educated&mdash;Americans
and Englishmen entertain the weird
notion that there exists some distant relationship between
Bohemians, bohemians and gypsies, is, alas, too
true. In the novel <i>Strathmore</i>, Louise de la Ram&eacute;e
(Ouida) for instance, asserts quite seriously that gypsies
in Bohemia have Slavonic features, that their language
is a dialect of the Bohemian and that the &ldquo;lawless,
vagrant, savage race&rdquo; is a Slavic tribe domiciled
in Bohemia.</p>

<p>Not a few are misled by the term Czech, thinking it
probably signifies a people other than the Bohemians.
A New York paper, in enumerating the disaffected
races of Austria-Hungary, named the Bohemians <i>and</i>
the Czechs. This is precisely like saying Yankees <i>and</i>
Americans or Germans <i>and</i> Teutons, for, as informed
readers are aware Bohemians and the Czechs are one
and the same.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Of the continental nations, Germany excepted, the
French were the first to look inquiringly into the queer
Austrian household. No doubt they were led to study
Slavic Austria largely because of their alliance with
Russia and because of their historical friendship for
the Poles. Due to the labor of three pioneers, Saint-Ren&eacute;<!--was R&eacute;n&eacute;--><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">-&nbsp;15&nbsp;-</a></span>
Taillandier (1817-1879), Louis Leger (1843-)
and Ernest Denis (1849-) <i>La Nation Tch&egrave;que</i> is no
longer unknown in France. Other and younger
Frenchmen,&mdash;to name one, Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;radame, the
author of the widely quoted volume, <i>The Pangerman
Plot Unmasked</i>,&mdash;continue the apostolary work in
France; but Taillandier, Leger and Denis will always
be honored as the pioneers of this propaganda. Of the
trio, Ernest Denis, Professor of the Sorbonne, stands
closest to the Bohemian heart. Denis&rsquo; monumental
researches, <i>Huss et la Guerre des Hussites</i>, <i>La Boh&ecirc;me
depuis la Montagne Blanche</i>, and <i>Fin de l&rsquo;ind&eacute;pendance
Boh&ecirc;me</i>, when published, may be said to have caused
a sensation. Unhampered by the censor, Denis was
able to bring out facts of Bohemia&rsquo;s past which were
a revelation to the Bohemians themselves.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon who visited the Hapsburg dominions
thirty or forty years ago was yet unable to see
anything but Teuton Austria; that is to say, he looked
at Bohemia and the other Austrian states wholly from
the official viewpoint of Vienna.</p>

<p>As a sample of the notions of Bohemia and the
&#268;echs professed in America and England a generation
ago, suffice it to cite a passage or two from Bayard
Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Views A-Foot</i>, or <i>Europe seen with Knapsack
and Staff</i>: &ldquo;The very name of Bohemia is associated
with wild and wonderful legends, of the rude
barbaric ages. The civilized race, the Saxon race, was
left behind; I saw around me the features and heard
the language of one of those rude Slavonian tribes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">-&nbsp;16&nbsp;-</a></span>
whose original home was on the vast steppes of Central
Asia(!)&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;In passing the shrines by the
wayside, the poor degraded peasants always uncovered
or crossed themselves, but it appeared to be rather the
effect of habit than any good impulse for the Bohemians
are noted all over Germany for their dishonesty....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taylor&rsquo;s grossly distorted appraisal of Bohemia was
not shared by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, as appears
from the following lines by the famous American
poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="lftquot">&ldquo;Hold your tongues! both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swabian and Saxon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bold Bohemian cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there&rsquo;s a heaven upon this earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Bohemia it lies.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Overnight the Great War has changed many a
wrong notion. &ldquo;Time changes all, and by time is truth
to victory guided; what in their errors the years
planned, in a day is o&rsquo;erthrown,&rdquo; prophetically sings
John Koll&aacute;r, the great Slovak poet. Following the
example of the French, several English and American
writers, Henry Wickham Steed, R. W. Seton-Watson
and Will S. Monroe among them, have in recent years
paid visits to Bohemia, and the result is both surprising
and gratifying. It is certain that, once aroused,
Anglo-Saxon curiosity will not abate until it has
learned all about Bohemia, even though the knowledge
obtained may disagree with the Alice in Wonderland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">-&nbsp;17&nbsp;-</a></span>
tales that have been related in Vienna to the old time
British and American travelers.</p>

<p>A new development in the study of Bohemia and
her people by foreigners may be said to date from the
time the dual system of government was introduced
(1867). Until then the interest of scholars was confined
wholly to historic and sectarian questions; from
that time on, political and ethnological issues began
to engage their serious attention.</p>

<p>The present bibliography lists, besides books and
pamphlets, magazine articles only; it does not pretend
to register items appearing in the weekly, much less in
the daily press. To attempt the latter would be beyond
the scope and purpose of the catalogue. Exceptions
to the rule have been made in favor of articles
bearing the signature of authors who are known to be
especially qualified to discuss the subjects selected by
them.</p>

<p>Scarcely a book has been written on Austria or the
Slavs which does not, directly or indirectly, discuss
Bohemia and the &#268;echs. The catalogue cannot take
cognizance of such publications, although, in this respect
also, the rule has been relaxed and books have
been indexed, dealing broadly with Austria and the
Slavs. Colquhoun&rsquo;s <i>The Whirlpool of Europe:
Austria-Hungary and the Hapsburgs</i>, Steed&rsquo;s <i>The
Hapsburg Monarchy</i> and Seton-Watson&rsquo;s <i>German,
Slav, and Magyar</i> may be cited as typical examples of
these publications.</p>

<p>Quite correctly the spelling of proper names, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">-&nbsp;18&nbsp;-</a></span>
obsolescent, has been left undisturbed. The Bohemians
spell Hus, not Huss; &#381;i&#382;ka, not Zisca. Comenius
is a Latinized form dating back to an age when it was
the custom to Latinize one&rsquo;s surname; the real name is
Komensk&yacute; and Bohemian history knows the educator
by this name only.</p>

<p>The authors have availed themselves of the skilled
services of Leonard C. Wharton, who was asked to
look into the rare Bohemica preserved in the British
Museum. Mr. Wharton performed this part of the
work with painstaking care.</p>

<p>Many of the seventeenth century items have been
extracted from the <i>British Museum Catalogue of
Printed Books</i>. <i>The Catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts</i>
in the British Museum has yielded <i>The Historie
of Bohemia</i>, written presumably in the first quarter of
the seventeenth century. Items of minor value were
obtained from the <i>State Papers of John Thurloe</i>; the
<i>Harleian Miscellany, or a collection of scarce, curious
and entertaining Pamphlets and Tracts</i>; Robert Watts&rsquo;
<i>Bibliotheca Britannica, or a General Index to British
and Foreign Literature</i>. For numerous current items
the authors are indebted to <i>Poole&rsquo;s Index to Periodical
Literature</i> and the <i>Readers&rsquo; Guide to Periodical Literature</i>.</p>

<p>The reader will probably agree with the present
authors that but for Bohemia&rsquo;s Protestant past, Anglo-American
Bohemica would be practically non-existent.
Strip the source book of Hus, of the events which followed
the Reformation and the anti-Reformation, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-</a></span>
the United Brethren and their alleged offspring, the
Moravians, of Komensk&yacute;, and Bohemia would stand
before the Anglo-American world like Cinderella from
the fairy tale&mdash;unwritten about, still waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>The bibliography proper is subdivided into twenty-two
parts, a brief and relevant comment accompanying
each part. The respective sub-titles are: Art, Bibliography,
Biography, Bohemian Glass, Dictionaries,
Drama, Fiction, Folk and Fairy Tales, Guides, History,
John Hus, John Amos Komensk&yacute;, Language and
Literature, Miscellany, Music, Periodicals, Plans and
Maps, Politics, Prague, Sociology and Economics,
Sokols, Travel and Description. A separate chapter,
entitled Bohemia in the British State Papers and
Manuscripts, contains bibliographical extracts from the
<i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, the <i>Reports of the British
Historical Manuscripts Commission</i>, the <i>Reports of the
Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts</i>, <i>Papal
Registers</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The especial acknowledgments of the authors are
due to Prof. Will S. Monroe, author of <i>Bohemia and
the &#268;echs</i>, and to Mr. Leonard C. Wharton of London.
Prof. Monroe kindly read and compared with his own,
the bibliography on Komensk&yacute;. The material which
Mr. Wharton has sent from England emphasizes anew
the enthusiastic interest he takes in the language, history
and literature of the Bohemian people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art.</span> Reference is made in this biographical manual
to the work of three artists. The first is V&aacute;clav<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">-&nbsp;20&nbsp;-</a></span>
Holar of Pr&aacute;che&#328;, or Wenceslaus Hollar, as his name
was spelled in England. A Protestant exile, whom the
edicts of anti-reformation had driven from his home,
Hollar drifted to England, where he gained the reputation
as the foremost etcher of his time. His plates,
which number about 2,400 pieces, are highly prized
by art collectors. &ldquo;He drew plans, prospects and portraits;
habits and dresses; churches, monuments and
antiquaries, or etched designs by famous Italian, German,
Dutch and English masters, some done from the
collection of King Charles I. and especially from those
belonging to Thomas Earl of Arundel, who brought
Hollar to and supported him in England.&rdquo; (Vertue).
Born in 1607 in Prague, he was buried in St. Margaret&rsquo;s,
Westminster, 28th of March, 1677. He showed
the lasting attachment to his fatherland by signing
many of his works &ldquo;Wenceslaus Hollar Bohemus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>V&aacute;clav Bro&#382;&iacute;k (1851-1901) was a noted painter of
historic subjects. His greatest picture is &ldquo;Master John
Hus condemned to death by the Council of Constance,&rdquo;
now the property of the municipality of Prague.
American art lovers will remember Bro&#382;&iacute;k&rsquo;s &ldquo;Defenestration,
or thrown from the window at Prague,&rdquo; exhibited
at the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair. The New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art owns a large canvas by
him, &ldquo;Columbus at the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella.&rdquo;
The Lenox Library (now the New York Public
Library) has &ldquo;Rudolph II. in the Laboratory of
his Alchymist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Grandmother&rsquo;s Namesday.&rdquo;
&ldquo;As a historical painter, Bro&#382;&iacute;k equals the greatest by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">-&nbsp;21&nbsp;-</a></span>
<!--[Blank Page]-->
his breadth of conception, fine composition, strength of
work and dramatic effect.&rdquo; This is the estimate of the
painter by Mr. Larroument, Secretary of the French
<i>Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts</i>. For his art galleries in
New York and Philadelphia, John Wanamaker purchased
several of the artist&rsquo;s smaller themes, and from
his executors the entire contents of his Paris studio,
studies, sketches, antiques, draperies and hangings.</p>

<p>Alfons M. Mucha, born in 1860 in Moravia, earned
his spurs in Paris as a poster artist. He is not unknown
in the United States, having visited this country
on two or three occasions, working here as portraitist,
illustrator and interior decorator. For several
years he has been engaged on a series of allegories intended
to portray the historical development of the
Slavs. When finished, the canvases are to be presented
to the City of Prague as the gift of the well-known
Slavophile, Charles R. Crane of Chicago and New
York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bibliography.</span> So far as the writers know, no one
has before this concerned himself with a systematic
compilation of a bibliography of this kind. The late
Herman Rosenthal, Director of the Slavonic Department
of the New York Public Library, is said to have
been at work on a Slavic bibliography; but his literary
executors have not yet published it. Dr. A. Sum,
member of the English Club in Prague, has taken
more than a passing interest in English Bohemica. The
late Jeffrey D. Hrbek, an exceptionally gifted young
man (see his biography published posthumously), prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">-&nbsp;22&nbsp;-</a></span>
for the <i>Osv&#283;ta Americk&aacute;</i> (1908) what was then
considered to be a fairly exhaustive bibliography. The
list mentions ninety volumes, many of them containing
but remote and irrelevant allusions to Bohemia.
The bibliography appended to Miss Balch&rsquo;s <i>Our Slavic
Fellow Citizens</i> is quite considerable; however, this
work treats not of Bohemians alone, but of all the
Slavs, and, when the process of elimination is applied,
it will be seen that the purely Bohemian share of reference
books is small. Then there is Leonard C.
Wharton&rsquo;s list, printed in the <i>Guide to the Kingdom
of Bohemia</i>; this takes notice of thirty-five items. As
regards the Hus and the Moravian Church literatures,
Wm. Gunn Malin&rsquo;s catalogue is, without doubt, the
richest and the most valuable of all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biography.</span> Biographical material in the several
encyclop&aelig;dias is meagre and perfunctory and what
there is of it has been chiefly extracted from German
lexicons. Count L&uuml;tzow edited items on Bohemia for
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. J. J. Kr&aacute;l has written
for <i>Johnson&rsquo;s Universal Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> short biographical
sketches of several authors&mdash;Jungmann, Koll&aacute;r, N&#283;mcov&aacute;,
Neruda and the Jire&#269;eks among them. The
<i>Biographical Dictionary of the Library of the World&rsquo;s
Best Literature</i> contains the lives of some two dozen
men of letters. Injudiciously the editor of the <i>Biographical
Dictionary</i> has included among Bohemian
(&#268;ech) writers Charles Sealsfield (pseudonym of Karl
Anton Postl, by some written Postel) and Fritz
Mauthner. While it is true that the first named was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">-&nbsp;23&nbsp;-</a></span>
born in Moravia and the other in Bohemia, both Sealsfield
and Mauthner were, as a matter of fact, Germans.</p>

<p>P. Selver in his <i>Anthology of Modern Bohemian
Poetry</i> gives, besides specimens of their verse, an illuminating
account of the lives of a number of poets.
The biographies of the literary workers of old Bohemia
are treated adequately in L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s <i>History of Bohemian
Literature</i>.</p>

<p>No &#268;ech has been more written about than Hus;
and, incidentally, none has shed greater lustre on his
native land than he. Every volume dealing with the
causes and effects of the Reformation necessarily considers
Hus&rsquo;s part therein. Associated with Hus usually
appears the name of his fellow-martyr, Jerome
of Prague.</p>

<p>Biographies of Komensk&yacute; are not wanting, for
which thanks are due principally to educators the world
over, who regard Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s writings as milestones
in the progress of education.</p>

<p>Music, speaking as it does a language which is universally
understood, has granted a passport to Anton
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k and in a lesser degree to Bed&#345;ich Smetana and
Zd&#283;nek Fibich.</p>

<p>The interested public will find many portraits and
life sketches in Vicker&rsquo;s, Gregor&rsquo;s, Maurice&rsquo;s and Monroe&rsquo;s
volumes. Some have been published in <i>The
Bohemian Voice</i>; however, complete files of this magazine
are now exceedingly rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bohemian Glass</span> is renowned everywhere for its
excellence and beauty. The industry is an old one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">-&nbsp;24&nbsp;-</a></span>
and there are some two thousand shops and factories
in the country engaged in the making of it. As an
export article Bohemian glass constitutes a major item.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dictionaries. Grammars. Interpreters.</span> Adolf
William Straka, (died in London in 1872), a political
exile, who lived for years in England, becoming a British
subject, was the first to write an <i>English Bohemian
Grammar</i>. It was printed in Prague in 1862.</p>

<p>The first English Bohemian dictionary, by Charles
Jon&aacute;&#353;, was published in Racine, Wisconsin. Before
emigrating to the United States in 1863, Jon&aacute;&#353; spent
some time in London. In the English metropolis he
associated with Straka and the inference is that the
author of the <i>English Bohemian Grammar</i> inspired a
liking for lexicographical work in his younger fellow-exile.</p>

<p>Charles Jon&aacute;&#353;, the &ldquo;first Bohemian in America&rdquo; was
born in 1840 and died abroad in 1896 while serving
the United States in the capacity of Consul. He was
buried in Prague, &ldquo;in the land he loved above all else.&rdquo;
Although he was not a philologist by training, having
studied in a technological institute, he plunged courageously
into lexicography. His introductory work was
the <i>Bohemian English Interpreter</i> (1865), followed by
the <i>Dictionary of the English and Bohemian Languages</i>
(1876). Like every initial effort, the dictionary
was deficient in many respects. Each succeeding
edition, however, was improved and amplified, so that
now Jon&aacute;&#353;&rsquo; dictionaries compare favorably with like
German publications. Other American Bohemians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">-&nbsp;25&nbsp;-</a></span>
have achieved political distinction in the United States
(Jon&aacute;&#353; was successively State Senator, Lieutenant
Governor of Wisconsin and U. S. Consul at Prague),
yet Jon&aacute;&#353; the journalist, Jon&aacute;&#353; the author, Jon&aacute;&#353; the
politician had not, in the estimation of pioneer immigrants,
an equal among his American co-nationals.</p>

<p>F. B. Zdr&#367;bek&rsquo;s <i>Anglick&aacute; mluvnice</i> (1870) is the
earliest publication of its kind in America. Crude
typographically and faulty textually, the volume is a
compliment neither to the printer nor to the author.
Jon&aacute;&#353; and Zdr&#367;bek, one will observe, worked along
parallel lines. This is explained by the circumstance
that the two men were attached to two rival newspaper
and printing concerns&mdash;Jon&aacute;&#353; to the weekly <i>Slavie</i>
published in Racine, and Zdr&#367;bek to the daily <i>Svornost</i>
of Chicago.</p>

<p>F. B. Zdr&#367;bek, for over thirty years editor of the
Chicago <i>Svornost</i>, and one of the leaders of the Bohemian
rationalists in the United States, was born in
1842 and died in Chicago in 1911. He took a course
first in a Catholic, then in a Protestant theological
seminary. Convinced that &ldquo;as a minister of the gospel
he could not make an honorable living unless he chose
to make of his vocation a vulgar traffic and practiced
from the pulpit pious extortion,&rdquo; as he wrote in his
autobiography, he gave up the ministry and devoted
himself to journalism. Most prolific of all the American
Bohemian men of letters, Zdr&#367;bek was in fact not
a creative writer but a translator. As a journalist he
was distinctly commonplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">-&nbsp;26&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, teacher in a Chicago school, has
given the public in his <i>Anglicky snadno ve t&#345;iceti
&uacute;loh&aacute;ch</i>, one of the best hand-books for the learning of
the English language thus far compiled. Zmrhal&rsquo;s
method of pronunciation is clearly an improvement
over all previous books; certainly it is superior to
Zdr&#367;bek&rsquo;s, who after all, possessed but a book knowledge
of English.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, is a comprehensive <i>U&#269;ebnice</i> by
F. Francl of New York. Altogether it may be stated
that grammars and interpreters by American Bohemians
who know alike the vocabulary and the spirit
of the English tongue, are more serviceable, if not
wholly superior to most of the &ldquo;English Easy and
Quick&rdquo; hand-books which have been published in
Prague.</p>

<p>The most versatile linguist in Bohemia was Francis
Vymazal (1841-1917), who compiled a lengthy row of
manuals of the &ldquo;English at a glance&rdquo; type. Vymazal&rsquo;s
series includes the study of English, Bulgarian, Russian,
French, Hebrew, Dutch, Latin, Magyar, German,
Gypsy, Modern Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian,
Slovak, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Old Greek, Spanish,
Turkish and Italian. Owing to his manner of life and
dress&mdash;he was not afraid to lead the life of a lowly
proletarian&mdash;the people of Brno, in which city he lived
and died, nicknamed him &ldquo;Bohemian Diogenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drama.</span> That the Poles and the Bohemians, two
submerged nations, have each given to the American
stage a tragic actress&mdash;the Poles Helena Modjeska, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">-&nbsp;27&nbsp;-</a></span>
Bohemians Frances Janauschek&mdash;may and may not be
accidental. Many people have supposed Janauschek
to be a German tragedienne, because in the early years
of her career, before she mastered the English language,
she played in German, on the German stage.
But she was of pure Bohemian stock, born in Prague
in 1830. By virtue of her long residence in America
and her devotion to and life-long association with the
American stage, she was really an American actress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fiction.</span> Translations from fiction are disappointingly
few. Of course, this is no evidence that Bohemia
has no fiction writers; the truth is that she has not
found Isabella Hapgoods and Jeremiah Curtins to
translate what she has. With one notable exception,
Bo&#382;ena N&#283;mcov&aacute;&rsquo;s <i>Babi&#269;ka</i>, nothing worth note has
been rendered into English from the prose. The story
<i>Maria Felicia</i> by Karolina Sv&#283;tl&aacute;, which an American
Bohemian woman has translated into English, is no
more typical of Bohemia than it is of Finland, Spain
or any other country. One should not only know how
to translate, but, what is just as essential, what to
translate. A. V. &#352;milovsk&yacute;, whose story, <i>Nebesa</i>, the
Moureks translated, is a meritorious writer, but by no
means of the high type of Alois Jir&aacute;sek or Julius
Zeyer.</p>

<p>Several foreign writers of fiction have made use of a
Bohemian theme more or less successfully, the earliest
of them being George Sand. Unfortunately Sand&rsquo;s
Bohemians in <i>Consuelo</i> and in its sequel <i>The Countess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">-&nbsp;28&nbsp;-</a></span>
of Rudolstadt</i>, are about as real as Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s
Man Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Folk and Fairy Tales.</span> Karel Jarom&iacute;r Erben
(1811-1870), whose folk tales Rev. Wratislaw translated
into English, is recognized as an authority on
folk lore. &ldquo;If Erben had left nothing else but his
<i>Nosegay of National Folk Tales</i>, his name would
always rank among Bohemian writers of the first magnitude,&rdquo;
says a critic. Most of the writers of folk
tales here listed have borrowed from Erben.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Guide to the Kingdom of Bohemia</span>, published
in Prague in 1906, is primarily intended to attract
travelers to the ancient capital of the country;
however, the information it contains is of interest alike
to travelers and to non-travelers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">History.</span> Probably the first instance in which the
English and the Bohemians came into contact with each
other, although as foes on the field of battle, occurred
in 1346 at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy. Here fell, fighting on
the side of the French, against the English, John of
Luxemburg, the blind King of Bohemia. King John&rsquo;s
crest was three ostrich feathers and his motto &ldquo;I
serve&rdquo;; which the Prince of Wales and his successors
adopted in memorial of this great victory of the English.</p>

<p>A more agreeable event in the relationship of England
and Bohemia took place thirty-six years later
(1382), when Richard II. engaged himself to Anne of
Luxemburg, the granddaughter of the very ruler whom
the English had fought at Cr&eacute;cy. The popular though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">-&nbsp;29&nbsp;-</a></span>
erroneous belief is that through Queen Anne the writings
of Wicliffe were introduced into Bohemia. In
her readable <i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>, Agnes
Strickland devotes a few warmly written pages to
&ldquo;Anne of Bohemia, surnamed the Good, first Queen
of Richard II.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gallant knight, Sir Simon Burley, the English
ambassador, was charged with bringing Richard&rsquo;s
bride from Prague to London. &ldquo;England was to Bohemia
a sort of terra incognita; and as a general
knowledge of geography and statistics was certainly
not among the list of imperial accomplishments in the
fourteenth century, the empress (Anne&rsquo;s mother) despatched
duke Primislaus of Saxony on a voyage of
discovery, to ascertain, for the satisfaction of herself
and the princess what sort of country England might
be.&rdquo;<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>England may have seemed an out of the way land
to the Bohemians of old, yet the English people were
by no means unknown to them. The fondness of the
Bohemians for travel in foreign countries was well
known.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> That entertaining compilation of wonder-stories
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">-&nbsp;30&nbsp;-</a></span>
comprised in <i>Sir John Mandeville&rsquo;s Travels</i>
was translated at an early date into the national language.
Students from Bohemia were wont to go to the
universities at Oxford and Paris in order to broaden
their education. Jerome of Prague is known to have
studied at Oxford. Like others of his countrymen he
had been drawn thither by the fame of Wicliff&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Most readers will be surprised to learn that a Bohemian
had been one of the torchbearers of Reformation
in Scotland. The name of this minor reformer
is Paul of Krava&#345; or Crawar, as Scotch writers spell
the name. According to Burton<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &ldquo;Crawar was a German,
believed to have come from Bohemia to propose
the doctrines that had been preached by John Hus and
Jerome of Prague. All that we are told of him personally
is that he professed to be a physician, and to
be traveling and visiting in the practice of his calling.&rdquo;
Krava&#345; was burned at St. Andrews, July 23, 1433, as
a heretic Hussite. &ldquo;The churchman who records his
burning,&rdquo; relates Burton, &ldquo;takes occasion to enlarge
on the characteristics of Taborites and other Bohemian
heretics.&rdquo; Lang<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> states that &ldquo;he was an envoy of the
Hussite &lsquo;miscreants.&rsquo; Lawrence of Lindores attacked
him, but he found him well read in scriptures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At no time before or after have the English taken
a more genuine interest in Bohemia and her affairs
than during the events which followed the outbreak
of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. Their concern over what
was happening in Bohemia at that time was due,
mainly, to two reasons. The first was that an Englishwoman,
a daughter of the reigning family, had
been elevated to the dignity of queen of that country.
The second motive was a religious one. Bohemia lay in
the direct zone of the conflict raging between Catholicism
and Protestantism and Protestant England
could not but be gravely concerned over the fate of
Protestant Bohemia. Money was collected and troops
were raised to sustain the cause of the Stuart Queen
in Prague and incidentally of Protestantism and it has
been said that if James had given his daughter the support
which she and her husband expected from him,
Bohemia&rsquo;s position might have been wholly different
today. But &ldquo;King James,&rdquo; a historian tells us, &ldquo;never
stood greatly affected, either to this war, or to the
cause thereof and thereupon some regiments of inexperienced
volunteers going over, instead of a well
composed army, it was one reason, among many
others, that not only Bohemia, but the Palatinate were
also lost....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elizabeth graced the Bohemian throne only for a
few months between 1619-1620, but she insisted upon
bearing the title of Queen of Bohemia to the end of
her days (1596-1662). Likewise her husband, Frederick,
(1596-1632) &ldquo;was resolved to foregoe not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">-&nbsp;32&nbsp;-</a></span>
title of the King of Bohemia that he hath allreadie
gotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Britain rejoiced when Elizabeth the &ldquo;Pearl of the
Stuarts&rdquo; was wedded to Frederick of the Palatinate.
John Taylor, the Water-Poet, wrote a poem about the
&ldquo;beloved Marriage of the two peerelesse Paragons of
Christendome.&rdquo; Historians have dutifully chronicled
the event of &ldquo;the most blessed and happie marriage
betweene the High and Mightie Prince Frederick the
Fifth, Count Palatine of the Rhein, Duke of Bavier,
etc. And the most Vertvous, Gracious and thrice excellent
Princesse, Elizabeth, Sole Daughter to our dread
Soueraigne, James by the grace of God, King of Great
Britaine, France and Ireland, etc., celebrated at White-Hall
the fourteenth of Februarie, 1612.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1619, the Bohemian Protestant Estates deposed
their King and offered the crown to Frederick, in the
hope that the &ldquo;King of England would, out of his three
kingdoms, send such a continued stock of men to the
Palatinate, that the crown of Bohemia should be established
on the head of the Elector Palatinate and that
by no course sooner than by virtue of the English
arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We read of the &ldquo;Departure of the high and mightie
Prince Frederick King Elect of Bohemia: With his
royall and vertuous Ladie Elizabeth: And the thryse
hopefull yong Prince Henrie, from Heydelberg towards
Prague, to receive the Crowne of that Kingdome.
Whereunto is annexed the Solempnitie or
maner of the Coronation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">-&nbsp;33&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>On another page the reader will find a quaint account
of the coronation ceremonies in Prague written
by an eyewitness, presumably John Harrison.</p>

<p>On the 8th day of November, 1620, near Prague,
on the slopes of the White Hill (B&iacute;l&aacute; Hora), was
fought a fateful battle between the Imperialists
(Austrians) and the Bohemian Army.</p>

<p>Referring to this catastrophal battle, which cost Bohemia
her independence, Sir Charles Montagu, English
Ambassador stationed at Vienna wrote to his kinsman,
Sir Edward Montagu: &ldquo;To begin with the worst
first, there is news come now of more certain truth
than heretofore from Bohemya, which is that the
King&rsquo;s army hath had a great overthrow, and Prage
is lost, but the King and Queen are at a strong place
called Presslaw in Selecya, and the King of Hungary
and he have met and they both intend to raise a far
greater force to set on them (the Imperialists) suddenly;
God give them better success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King of Bohemia, as subsequent events proved,
did not meet with better success. In a day or two
after that fatal 8th day of November, when Bohemia
was going to her destruction, he left Prague precipitately
with his queen, never to return to that capital....</p>

<p>Bohemian historians speak in terms of warm praise
of Elizabeth, the &ldquo;Winter Queen,&rdquo; but their estimate
of Frederick, &ldquo;First Prince of the Imperiall bloud,
sprung from glorious Charlemaigne,&rdquo; falls lamentably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">-&nbsp;34&nbsp;-</a></span>
short of the measure taken of him by the Bohemian
Estates, as reprinted on another page.</p>

<p>Conceivably for the &ldquo;Winter Queen&rsquo;s&rdquo; enlightenment,
John Harrison, who accompanied the royal pair
to Prague in the capacity of court chaplain, sketched
the &ldquo;Historie of Bohemia, the first parte describing the
Countrye, Scituation, Climate, Commodities, the Name
and Nature of the People and compendiously continuing
the Historie from the beginning of the Nation to
the First Christian Prince, about the year of Christ
990.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking &ldquo;in the name of all our exiled nation&rdquo; the
Bohemian Church appealed for help &ldquo;to the lord protector,
his highness council, and the parliament.&rdquo;<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As in the case of the Waldenses, Protector Cromwell
ordered a national subscription; and a handsome
amount was collected during the spring of 1658 to relieve
the distress of Bohemian Protestants. Komensk&yacute;
and his fellow exiles were invited to settle in Ireland,
the Protector desiring to strengthen the Protestant
element there. The &ldquo;Act for the Satisfaction of
Adventurers and Soldiers&rdquo; authorized &ldquo;all persons of
what nation soever professing the Protestant religion
to rent or purchase forfeited lands,&rdquo; but the Dutch,
German and Bohemian emigrants whom this clause
contemplated never came.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Believing in the fulfillment
of Drab&iacute;k&rsquo;s false prophecy, that the cause of Protestantism
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">-&nbsp;35&nbsp;-</a></span>
in Bohemia would prevail in the end and that
the exiles would yet return home in triumph, Komensk&yacute;
hesitated to accept England&rsquo;s proffer.</p>

<p>Protestant refugees, who had been driven from
home by Ferdinand&rsquo;s edicts, wandered to England in
pursuit of religious freedom and livelihood. Simon
Partlicius (1593-1639), preacher and author and
Samuel Martinius (1588-1640), writer and mathematician,
both enjoyed England&rsquo;s hospitality for a time.
So did Komensk&yacute; who came in 1642 to London to
visit friends and to further his literary projects. Wenceslaus
Hollar established a permanent residence in
England. Letters are extant written by Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s
son-in-law, Peter Figulus, and dated at Oxford. At
least two exiles, Wenceslaus Libanus and Paul Hartmann,
both members of the Brethren&rsquo;s Unity, had
been ordained as ministers of the Church of England.</p>

<p>That the Irish Franciscans had been invited to Bohemia
during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War to assist in the
re-Catholisation of the country, is known. In Hybernsk&aacute;
ulice, a famous thoroughfare in Prague, named
after them, the Irish Friars founded a monastery in
1630. Later (1659) they built there the Church of
Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. Although the
monastery has long passed out of existence and even
the church edifice has been forced to give way to business,
the name, Hybernsk&aacute; ulice, still reminds the
tourist of the presence of the Hibernians in Prague.
An Irish name&mdash;that of Count Edward Francis Josef
Taafe&mdash;has figured largely in Austrian and Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">-&nbsp;36&nbsp;-</a></span>
politics of yesterday. The Taafes secured an incholate
in Moravia in the middle of the eighteenth century
and have intermarried with the &#352;lik, Chotek and
Pachta families.</p>

<p>No narrative of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War is complete
or understandable unless the student knows what part
Bohemia took in the great struggle. A recognized
authority on the subject is Anton Gindely, (1829-1892)
Professor at the Prague University. Gindely&rsquo;s
<i>Geschichte des dreissigj&auml;hrigen Krieges</i> has been
translated by A. Ten Brook.</p>

<p>A quarter of a century ago one could not find on
the shelves of an American library a comprehensive
history of the Bohemian nation written in English.
The task and the distinction of writing such a work
fell to the lot of a Chicago lawyer of Scotch-Irish
ancestry, Robert H. Vickers. Vicker&rsquo;s <i>History of Bohemia</i>
was published in 1894 in Chicago, the munificence
of the Bohemian National Committee making
the publication possible. Stranger to the subtle modern
forces of the nation&rsquo;s life, unfamiliar with its
language, unduly in love with the rust of the past,
Vickers produced a volume suffering obviously from
bookiness. The Chicago Bohemians erected a monument
in the National Cemetery to the memory of their
Scotch-Irish friend.</p>

<p>A year later (1895), there appeared another history
of the nation: Frances Gregor&rsquo;s <i>Story of Bohemia</i>.</p>

<p>In translating into idiomatic English the little classic,
N&#283;mcov&aacute;&rsquo;s <i>Babi&#269;ka</i>&mdash;the first story book by a Bohemian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">-&nbsp;37&nbsp;-</a></span>
author to be so honored&mdash;Frances Gregor rendered
an actual service to literature. Many an American
Bohemian youth has had his or her first glimpse of
the charms of Bohemian country life from <i>Babi&#269;ka</i>,
but her <i>Story of Bohemia</i> has since been supplanted by
newer and abler historical studies. Frances Gregor&rsquo;s
talents lay not in historical research but in light fiction
writing and literary criticism. An incurable malady
greatly interfered with intensive literary labor, making
her life all but unendurable. She died in Colorado in
1901, aged fifty-one years.</p>

<p>Two additional histories were put on the market by
publishers in 1896: <i>Bohemia: an Historical Sketch</i>, by
Count L&uuml;tzow; and Charles Edmund Maurice&rsquo;s <i>Bohemia:
from the earliest times to the fall of national independence
in 1620</i>.</p>

<p>It is no secret that English Bohemica cost Count
L&uuml;tzow (born 1849 in Hamburg, died 1916 in Switzerland)
his diplomatic career, making him <i>persona non
grata</i> at the Vienna court. Of the several volumes
written by this high-minded, unselfish nobleman, the
most erudite and mature is <i>The Hussite Wars</i>. L&uuml;tzow
is especially esteemed by English-speaking Bohemians,
for they alone are able to appreciate the measure of his
labors.</p>

<p>Will S. Monroe&rsquo;s <i>Bohemia and the &#268;echs</i> was published
in 1910. It is profusely illustrated and contains
an informative review of the literature, art, politics
and the economic and social conditions of the people.
Monroe knows his Bohemia from close personal association
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">-&nbsp;38&nbsp;-</a></span>
and not from books alone, and his <i>Bohemia
and the &#268;echs</i> has achieved wider popularity than any
of the accounts preceding it.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cambridge Modern History</i> the student will
find abundant and reliable material on Bohemia, from
such noted writers as Robert Nisbet Bain, A. W.
Ward, Louis Eisenmann, and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hus. Jerome of Prague. Unity. Moravians.</span>
The Hussite Reformation in the fifteenth century
was a movement which concerned not Bohemia
alone, but the entire Christian world. &ldquo;Thus begun,&rdquo;
remarks Bishop de Schweinitz, &ldquo;one of the most remarkable
and at the same time terrific wars the world
has seen; for sixteen years Bohemia single handed defied
papal Europe.&rdquo; Two Englishmen, John Wickliffe
and Peter Payne, the first impersonally, through
his writings, the other personally, played not an inconspicuous
r&ocirc;le in the great religious awakening
which followed the burning of Hus at the stake in
1415.</p>

<p>The Hussite literature, as the reader will perceive,
is quite bulky. Of the non-Bohemian Hus scholars,
whose works have been written in English or translated
into that tongue, these deserve to be mentioned:
De Bonnechose, <i>Les R&eacute;formateurs avant la R&eacute;forme</i>,
known as <i>Reformers before the Reformation</i>; Johann
Loserth&rsquo;s <i>Hus und Wiclif</i>; De Schweinitz&rsquo;s <i>History of
the Church known as the Unitas Fratrum, or the Unity
of the Brethren</i>; Count L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s <i>The Hussite Wars</i>;
David S. Schaff&rsquo;s <i>John Huss; His Life, Teachings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">-&nbsp;39&nbsp;-</a></span>
Death</i>; W. N. Schwarze&rsquo;s <i>John Hus, the Martyr of
Bohemia</i>. Knowing the Bohemian language and being
in a position to make use of native sources, some of
them still unpublished, Count L&uuml;tzow has had an undoubted
advantage over Hus commentators who were
not so fitted. Rev. E. H. Gillett&rsquo;s <i>Life and Times of
John Huss</i>, was, after it had been published, adversely
commented upon, the author being openly charged with
taking bodily sentences, paragraphs and pages from
De Bonnechose, without giving the Frenchman due
credit. (See <i>North American Review</i>, July, 1865.)
Rev. A. H. Wratislaw&rsquo;s <i>John Huss, the commencement
of resistance to papal authority</i>, has for its basis
the trustworthy researches of the historians Palack&yacute;
and Tomek.</p>

<p>The Moravian Church, claiming direct descent from
the Unity of Bohemian Brethren, has produced noteworthy
sectarian literature. In fact, the Moravians,
to mention only one scholar, the late Bishop de Schweinitz,
have done more than any other evangelical
church in the way of interpreting to the English
speaking people the most stirring chapters of Bohemian
history.</p>

<p>There is this criticism to be made, however, in reference
to the Hus literature, that while non-Bohemian
writers regard Hus as a religious reformer only and
treat the reformation inaugurated by him wholly in the
light of a religious upheaval, the Bohemians insist on
taking a broader view of Hus and of Hussites. To them
Hus reveals himself not only as a religious reformer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">-&nbsp;40&nbsp;-</a></span>
but likewise as a champion and purifier of the native
tongue. In the Hussite Wars they recognize a political-spiritual
revolution, having for its purpose the liberation
of the Bohemian nation alike from papal trammels
and from German domination.</p>

<p>The Bohemian Church, Unity, Unitas Fratrum,
Unity of Bohemian Brethren, Brethren&rsquo;s Unity, are the
names given to a church which originated in the second
half of the fifteenth century. In the severely strict notions
as to what is proper in the practice of religious
duties, the Unity bore a striking resemblance to the
Puritans.</p>

<p>Its doctrine and discipline are admirably set forth in
the articles passed in 1616 at the Synod of &#381;eravice.
These articles, provided with annotations by Komensk&yacute;
have been translated into English, under the title
<i>Ratio disciplinae, or the Constitution of the Congregational
Churches</i>. Thus one is able to trace the influence
of the Unity upon the Church of England. When
the Bohemian Revolution broke out (1618) the nobility
belonging to the Unity were powerful enough to
influence the selection of a new King in the place of
Ferdinand II., who was dethroned by the Estates. The
choice, as we know, fell upon Frederick of the Palatinate.
The Patent of Tolerance, (1781) allowing
Protestant worship in Austria, purposely excluded the
Unity. To the Government the church was objectionable,
first because of its Bohemian national traditions,
and secondly because of the leading part its members
had taken in the revolution against Ferdinand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">-&nbsp;41&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the greatest writers of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries were members of the Unity:
John Augusta (1500-1572, Bishop and writer), John
Blahoslav (1523-1571), collaborator on the <i>Kralice
Bible</i>, author of <i>Grammatika &#268;esk&aacute;</i>, Charles, Lord of
&#381;erot&iacute;n (1564-1636), John Amos Komensk&yacute;. The
Unity reformed schools and promoted literature by
setting up printing shops in Bohemia and Moravia.
Toward the close of the fifteenth century a printing
shop was opened in Mlad&aacute; Boleslav; in the first part
of the sixteenth century another was established at
B&#283;l&aacute;, near Bezd&#283;z, and still another at Litomy&#353;l. The
last named town was, up to 1547, looked upon as the
chief seat of the administration of the church. Because
of persecution, the Unity transferred its centre
to P&#345;erov in Moravia. Here too, it set up printing establishments,
the one at Ivan&#269;ice becoming in time far-famed.
In 1578 the Ivan&#269;ice concern was moved to
Kralice (Moravia).</p>

<p>By common consent, the <i>Kralice Bible</i>, so called
from Kralice, where it was printed, is regarded as the
most enduring literary work of the Unity. For fourteen
years eight eminent scholars worked on this Bible,
rendering the translation into a language idiomatic,
and pure beyond that of any other book. It was published
between the years 1579-93, and Lord &#381;erot&iacute;n
bore the expense of it. The British Bible Society in
publishing a Bohemian Bible followed exactly the edition
of 1613.</p>

<p>The New York Lenox Library, which is now a part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">-&nbsp;42&nbsp;-</a></span>
of the New York Public Library, owns: 1. A complete
set of the <i>Kralice Bible</i>; the sixth volume, however, is
of a later edition. 2. Two copies of the <i>Prague Bible</i>.
3. One copy of the <i>Paul Sever&iacute;n of Kap&iacute; Hora Bible</i>
of the edition of 1537. The <i>Kralice Bible</i> was bought
by Lenox, the founder of the Lenox Library, from the
collection of the Duke of Sussex.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Amos Komensk&yacute;</span><!--was Komensky-->. John Amos Komensk&yacute;
(or Comenius, which is the Latinized form of the
name), one of the great figures in Bohemian history,
was born in 1592 in Moravia, (hence the suffix &ldquo;Moravus&rdquo;
seen on some of his works) and died as an exile
in 1670 in Holland.</p>

<p>Though he was a churchman of prominence, being
the last Bishop of the Unity, his reputation is founded
not on his ecclesiastical and philosophical writings, but
on his pedagogical studies. As a school reformer he
was the first to carry out the principle, long since recognized
as sound by all teachers, of appealing to the
senses; so he called the artist to his aid. The result
was the <i>Orbis Sensualium Pictus</i> or the <i>Visible World</i>.
&ldquo;The circumstances of his life were as unfavorable as
possible to his career as a writer,&rdquo; remarks L&uuml;tzow.
&ldquo;Traveling from Moravia to Bohemia, thence to Poland,
Germany, England, Sweden, Hungary, Holland,
ever unable to obtain tranquillity, often in financial
difficulties, twice deprived of his library by fire, forced
to write school-books, when he was planning metaphysical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">-&nbsp;43&nbsp;-</a></span>
works that he believed to be of the greatest
value, he always undauntedly continued his vast literary
undertakings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Cotton Mather<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we learn (a fact which is confirmed
by other sources) that Governor Winthrop offered
to Komensk&yacute; the Presidency of Harvard College.
&ldquo;That brave old man Johannes Amos Comenius,
the fame of whose worth hath been Trumpetted as far
as more than Three Languages (Whereof everyone is
endebted unto his Janua) could carry it, was agreed
withal by our Mr. Winthrop, in his travels through the
Low Countries, to come over into New England and
Illuminate this Colledge and Country in the Quality of
President: But the Solicitations of the Swedish ambassador,
diverting him another way, that Incomparable
Moravian became not an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Biographers are not agreed as to the number of
Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s works. F. J. Zoubek has enumerated 137
of them; Keatinge lists 127. Some were written in
Latin, others in Bohemian, though Komensk&yacute;, having
received his theological training in Germany, was conversant
with the language of that country also.</p>

<p>As a master of Bohemian diction he had few, if any,
peers. To the revivalists Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s writings were
a safe and never-failing storehouse of philologic material
and even today, despite the circumstance that
Bohemian syntax and orthography like the English,
have undergone an essential change, his style is a
source of delight to literary purists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">-&nbsp;44&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>His chief writings that have been translated into
English, and the main facts of their publication, are
as follows:</p>

<p><i>The Gate of Tongues Unlocked</i> first appeared in
Latin in Leszno (Lissa), Poland, in 1631; the same
year in German. The Bohemian edition is dated 1633,
the English 1633.</p>

<p><i>The School of Infancy.</i> This manual was written
primarily for the use of Bohemian schools, but when
the author realized that he could not return to his
fatherland, being a Protestant, the work was translated
into German. The English edition is dated 1641.
The Bohemian manuscript was discovered only in 1856
and put into print two years later.</p>

<p><i>A Reformation of Schooles</i> was printed for Michael
Sparke, London, 1642.</p>

<p><i>The History of the Bohemian Persecution</i>, which is
one of the author&rsquo;s church works, was completed in
Bohemian in 1632, but was not published in that
tongue until 1655. The date of the Latin version is
1647; of the English, 1650.</p>

<p>Jeremy Collier&rsquo;s rendering into English of the <i>Pansophiae</i>,
or, as the translator entitled it, <i>Patterne of
Universall Knowledge</i>, is dated, London, 1651. Published
in 1643, in Danzig, it was printed two years
later in Amsterdam. The Bohemian translation is
quite recent, dating from 1879. &ldquo;No one can impartially
claim for Komensk&yacute; a high rank as a philosopher,&rdquo;
comments Count L&uuml;tzow, &ldquo;and it is certainly a
mistake to speak of Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s system of philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">-&nbsp;45&nbsp;-</a></span>
There is no philosophical system of Komensk&yacute; in the
sense that there exists a philosophical system of
Spinoza.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Physicae</i> or <i>Naturall Philosophie Reformed by
Divine Light</i> was printed in Leipsic in 1633, in Amsterdam
1643, 1645, 1663, etc. The Bohemian translation
is recent. The English edition, in this catalogue,
is of 1651.</p>

<p><i>The True and Readie Way to Learne the Latine
Tongue</i> appeared in Leszno, 1633. It was translated
later into Dutch, English (our catalogue&rsquo;s London
edition is of 1654), Magyar, Swedish and Polish. The
Latin-Bohemian-German edition is dated Tren&#269;&iacute;n,
Hungary, 1649.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s most popular book, the <i>Orbis Sensualium
Pictus</i>, was printed originally in Nuremberg, in
1658. The English translation by Charles Hoole followed
one year later. The Latin-German-Magyar-Bohemian
edition was issued in 1685; the first American
edition, a reprint from Hoole&rsquo;s twelfth London
edition, in New York, in 1810.</p>

<p>That the English translation of <i>The Great Didactic</i>,
which Komensk&yacute; wrote between 1627-1632 in the Bohemian
language and in 1640 in Latin (published in
Amsterdam, 1657), was not undertaken until our time
(1896) is a matter of great surprise. The same comment
is pertinent to Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s most readable little
volume, <i>The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise
of the Heart</i>, which strikingly reminds one of Bunyan&rsquo;s
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. It was only in 1905 that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">-&nbsp;46&nbsp;-</a></span>
found an able translator in the person of Count L&uuml;tzow.
<i>The Praxis Pietatis</i>, an oft-quoted book which
passed through several editions in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries has not been translated for the
very good reason that it, in itself, was an adaptation,
from the <i>Practice of Piety</i>, a volume by an English
divine.</p>

<p><i>The Exhortation of the Churches of Bohemia to the
Church of England</i>, Englished by Joshua Tymarchus
and printed for Thomas Parkhurst, in Cheapside,
1661, was used eighty-seven years later as an argument
and a plea by a distinguished English American,
Gen. Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>Addressing the English Parliament (1748) in favor
of the passage of a bill to relieve the United Brethren,
or Moravians, from military duty and oaths, General
Oglethorpe explained that the &ldquo;Brethren were received
in England under King Edward the Sixth, and countenanced
under his successors.... And to speak a
few words of their further intercourse with the Church
of England. Their Bishop, Comenius, presented the
history of his church to King Charles the Second, in
the year 1660, with a moving account of their sufferings,
addressed to the Church of England.... In the
year 1683, a most pathetic account of these Brethren
was published by order of Archbishop Sancroft and
Bishop Compton. They also addressed the Church of
England, in the year 1715, being reduced to a very low
ebb in Poland; and his late Majesty, George I., by the
recommendation of the late Archbishop Wake, gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">-&nbsp;47&nbsp;-</a></span>
orders in Council for the relief of these reformed episcopal
churches, and Letters Patent for their support
were issued soon after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prognostications made in <i>Revelation Revealed
by two Apocalyptical Treatises</i>, is a book which relates
to prophecies and alleged visions by Christopher
Kotter, Christina Poniatovia and an unscrupulous impostor,
Nichols Drab&iacute;k by name. Genuinely believing
in the truth of the prophecies of this trio, Komensk&yacute;
was ridiculed and criticized by contemporaries, especially
by the Frenchman, Pierre Bayle (1647-1706)
in his <i>Dictionnaire Historique et Critique</i>. Hallam&rsquo;s
belittling appraisal of the author of <i>Orbis Sensualium
Pictus</i> (&ldquo;this author, a man of much industry, some
ingenuity, and a little judgment, made himself a temporary
reputation by his <i>Orbis Sensualium Pictus</i>,
etc.&rdquo;) is no doubt traceable to Bayle&rsquo;s unfavorable estimate.
Bayle&rsquo;s writings, be it remarked, were held in
high regard by men of letters of his time.</p>

<p>In 1892 educators the world over observed the three
hundredth anniversary of Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s birth. The
March (1892) number of the <i>Educational Review</i>
was wholly devoted to him; it contained articles by the
editor, Nicholas Murray Butler (now President of Columbia
University), S. S. Laurie, C. W. Bardeen, Paul
H. Hanus. The American Bohemians in several cities,
Chicago, New York, Omaha, Milwaukee and Cleveland,
by appropriate ceremonies also celebrated the anniversary
of the birth of their distinguished fellow-countryman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">-&nbsp;48&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Language and Literature.</span> <i>The Cheskian Anthology</i>
(1832) compiled by Sir John Bowring (1792-1872)
is the earliest known effort to acquaint the English
reading public with Bohemian literature which was
just then beginning to revive from the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War. Before this, Bowring had written
a sympathetic review for the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>
(1828) of Joseph Jungmann&rsquo;s <i>Historie literatury
&#269;esk&eacute;</i>. For the <i>Westminster Review</i> (1830) he wrote
a resum&eacute; of the <i>Manuscript of the Queen&rsquo;s Court</i>
(Rukopis Kralodvorsk&yacute;) since pronounced by philologists,
like Macpherson&rsquo;s Songs of Ossian, spurious.</p>

<p>Another Englishman who formed a deep attachment
for the youthful Bohemian republic of letters was
the Rev. Albert Henry Wratislaw (1821-1889). By
his several translations and original studies Wratislaw
rendered valuable service in England to the nation
from which his ancestors had sprung. Wratislaw
claimed descent from the ancient and honorable family
of the Wratislaws of Mitrovic. Conceivably the
relationship with the Wratislaws of Bohemia prompted
him to translate into English <i>The Adventures of Baron
Wenceslas Wratislaw of Mitrowitz</i>. Wratislaw&rsquo;s <i>Bohemian
Poems, Ancient and Modern</i>, from the original
Slavonic (Bohemian) is a skillful piece of work.</p>

<p>Writing under the pen name Talvj, Mrs. Robinson,
wife of the Rev. Robinson, has devoted a chapter in
her <i>Historical View of the Languages and Literatures
of the Slavonic Nations</i> to the <i>History of the Czekhish
or Bohemian Languages and Literature</i>. Mrs. Robinson&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">-&nbsp;49&nbsp;-</a></span>
views on Bohemian literature are by no means
her own. Palack&yacute; and &#352;afa&#345;&iacute;k have pointed out that
the chapter is nothing but an extract from Paul J.
&#352;afa&#345;&iacute;k&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der slavischen Sprache und Literatur
nach allen Mundarten</i>. The pseudonym Talvj,
by the way, she conceived by putting together the initial
letters of her maiden name, T. A. L. v. J., that is,
Theresa Albertina Louisa von Jacobi.</p>

<p>Flora P. Kopta&rsquo;s <i>Bohemian Legends and Other
Poems</i> is not a satisfying work. Far more felicitous
than her poetry is her prose volume, <i>The Forestman of
Vimpek</i>.</p>

<p>The credit for worthily introducing Bohemian
poetry belongs to an Englishman, P. Selver. <i>The Anthology
of Modern Bohemian Poetry</i> is an admirable
achievement. Not only is Selver&rsquo;s interpretation faithful,
but the selection of authors is representative.</p>

<p>Leo Wiener, a well-known Slavic scholar connected
with Harvard University, has presented to the public
a fine rendition of J. S. Machar&rsquo;s <i>Magdalen</i>.</p>

<p>Richard William Morfill (1835-1909), late Slavic
Professor at Oxford, has written voluminously on
Slavic history and philology. Among his philological
studies are: a simplified grammar of the Polish language,
a grammar of the Russian language, a grammar
of the Bulgarian language, <i>A Grammar of the Bohemian
or &#268;ech language</i>. The last named is the only
work of its kind in English, Charles Jon&aacute;&#353;&rsquo; <i>Bohemian
Made Easy</i> being really an interpreter and not a scientific
grammar. The Bohemian Literary Society of Chicago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">-&nbsp;50&nbsp;-</a></span>
it is reported, has in preparation a new English
grammar for the study of the &#268;ech language.</p>

<p>In Count L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s <i>History of Bohemian Literature</i>,
the student will find an excellent manual. With his
usual painstaking care, the author recounts in a lucid
manner the story of Bohemian literature, its glory and
its vicissitudes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miscellany.</span> Attention is called to a meritorious
volume under this subtitle, by de Moleville, <i>The Costumes
of the Hereditary (!) States of the House of
Austria</i>. Fifteen plates portray old Bohemian, Slovak
and Moravian costumes.</p>

<div class="caption">The Kralice Bible
<p class="hang">Though not the oldest in point of date, the Kralice Bible (1st ed. 1579-93,

the Lenox collection, it is now the property, with other rare Bohemian
Bibles, of the New York City Public Library</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Music.</span> Critics rate Bed&#345;ich Smetana (1824-1884)
as the greatest Bohemian composer, yet it is Dr. Anton&iacute;n
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k (1841-1904) who is the most widely
known outside of his native country. The reason for
this is that Dvo&#345;&aacute;k visited England and spent a number
of years in New York as director of a conservatory
of music. &ldquo;The forcefulness and freshness of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s
music,&rdquo; writes H. E. Krehbiel, the noted New
York musical critic, &ldquo;come primarily from his use of
dialects and idioms derived from the folk-music of the
Chekhs.... Dvo&#345;&aacute;k is not a nationalist in the
Lisztian sense; he borrows not melodies but the characteristic
elements from the folk-songs of his people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smetana&rsquo;s renown was won on precisely the same
ground which made Dvo&#345;&aacute;k famous, the only difference
being that Smetana applied the principle of the
folk-song before Dvo&#345;&aacute;k. Previous to Smetana&rsquo;s time
one could speak of music in Bohemia, but not of Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">-&nbsp;51&nbsp;-</a></span>
<!--[Blank Page]-->
music. George Benda (1721-1795), Joseph
Myslive&#269;ek (1737-1781), John Ladislav Dus&iacute;k (1761-1812&mdash;the
name of this &ldquo;neglected composer&rdquo; is also
spelled Dussek), V&aacute;clav John Tom&aacute;&#353;ek or Tomaschek
(1774-1850), author of the usual method of fingering
double scales, were writers of music who belonged to
the period when there was music in Bohemia, when
composers were content to imitate Beethoven, Bach,
Mozart and Wagner; when they strove to out-German
the Germans in music. Smetana was the first to strike
the true chord of inspiration&mdash;the chord touching the
nation&rsquo;s soul&mdash;the folk-song. It was the influence of
the folk-song which lent to his masterpiece, the <i>Bartered
Bride</i>, (Prodan&aacute; Nev&#283;sta) its exquisite charm
and enduring freshness. Apropos, the Bartered Bride
was introduced to the American public at the New
York Metropolitan Opera House on April 29, 1909,
and the baton on this unforgettable occasion was
wielded by Gustav Mahler, also a native of Bohemia,
though not a &#268;ech.</p>

<p>Of the several musical artists who have visited the
United States, none have won larger recognition from
the critics and the public than Jan Kubel&iacute;k (born
1880), violinist, Emmy Destinn (born 1878), soprano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Periodicals.</span> The long cherished wish that there
might be an English language newspaper which should
interpret to the Americans the ideals of the Bohemian
race was realized in September, 1892, when <i>The Bohemian
Voice</i>, a monthly printed in Omaha and published
by the National Committee, was issued. Through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">-&nbsp;52&nbsp;-</a></span>
lack of funds <i>The Bohemian Voice</i> was forced to suspend
publication in November, 1894. The first editor
of this &ldquo;organ of the Bohemian-Americans in the
United States&rdquo; was Thomas &#268;apek; upon his resignation,
in April, 1894, J. J. Kr&aacute;l took charge as editor.</p>

<p>The speculative <i>American Bi-Monthly</i>, launched in
Chicago in 1914, failed after publishing two numbers.</p>

<p>In February, 1917, the Bohemian National Alliance
in America started a monthly in Chicago, <i>The Bohemian
Review</i>. In the initial number the editor, Dr. J.
F. Smetanka, argues as follows: &ldquo;If some two hundred
thousand people<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> can support more than eighty
publications in the Bohemian language, why should
not three hundred thousand of their children, more
used to the English language, establish and support
just one organ devoted to their interests as Americans
of Czech descent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be added, that <i>The New
Europe</i>, of London, though by no means a Bohemian
or a Slavic magazine, has paid generous attention to
Bohemian questions as affected by the war. Among
the collaborators of <i>The New Europe</i> are such able
students of Austrian politics as Thomas G. Masaryk,
late Professor at the Bohemian University of Prague,
Dr. R. W. Seton-Watson of King&rsquo;s College and H.
Wickham Steed of the London <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plans, Maps. etc.</span> Of especial interest to the
students of American Colonial history is the <i>Map of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">-&nbsp;53&nbsp;-</a></span>
Virginia and Maryland this present Year 1670 Surveyed
and Exactly Drawne by the Only Labour and
Endeavour of Augustin Herrman, Bohemiensis</i>. A
copy of this rare map is on file in the Library of Congress
in Washington.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In addition to the Map of
Maryland, Herrman made a sketch of New Amsterdam
(New York) as that city looked in 1650. Herrman
is reputed to be the first Bohemian immigrant to
America, coming here in 1633. On the site of the
former Bohemia Manor in Cecil County, Maryland,
there is still preserved a tombstone bearing this inscription:
&ldquo;Avgvstine Herrmen Bohemian The First
Fovnder Seater of Bohemea Manner Anno 1661.&rdquo;
Like Wenceslaus Hollar, John Amos Komensk&yacute;, Paul
Sk&aacute;la ze Zho&#345;e, (the historian) and thousands of other
Protestants, Herrman, the son of a minister of the
gospel, was forced to flee from Bohemia after the
overthrow of the Protestants there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Politics and War Publications.</span> Publication has
received an unwonted impetus from the war. Never
since the Thirty Years&rsquo; War have the grievances and
political aspirations of the Bohemians been given more
widespread publicity. Woodrow Wilson stated the
situation precisely in one of his books when he declared
that &ldquo;no lapse of time, no defeat of hopes, seems sufficient
to reconcile the Czechs of Bohemia to incorporation
with Austria.&rdquo; Since 1848, the year which saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">-&nbsp;54&nbsp;-</a></span>
the dawn of constitutionalism in the Hapsburg monarchy,
the Bohemians have been asking for home rule;
the lessons of war at once suggested a bolder program,
a new orientation. Presently their leaders demand a
separation from Austria and the inclusion in an independent
Bohemian State of the Slovaks of Hungary.
Under this subtitle the reader will find indexed articles
by opponents (Heilprin) as well as by well-wishers.
Of the new orientation, that is, of a Bohemian-Slovak
State, free and independent, the leading intellect outside
of Bohemia is Professor Masaryk, temporarily an
exile in England.</p>

<p>Thomas Garrigue Masaryk (the middle name is assumed
from that of his American wife, Miss Charlotte
Garrigue of New York) is writing his name large in
what posterity will joyfully call Bohemian Emancipation.
Masaryk was born of humble Moravian-Slovak
parentage in 1850. From the time he entered public
life, he was always a rebel, though in the finest sense
of the term; rebel in politics, rebel in literature, rebel
in the manner he interpreted Bohemian nationalism.
That he was not summarily removed from the chair
he occupied in the Prague University was due to fear
of the man, to fear of his large following, and not to
the want of powerful accusers or because of scruples
on the part of the government. In native literature
and politics alike, Masaryk&rsquo;s activities are bound to
leave a deep mark. Fortunately for the cause, he was
able to effect his escape from Austria in the early
stages of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">-&nbsp;55&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>An able writer and a forceful advocate of Bohemia&rsquo;s
cause in the United States is Charles Pergler,
vice-president of the Bohemian National Alliance in
America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prague.</span> Von Humboldt was not the only traveler
who thought that the capital of the Bohemian Kingdom
was the most beautiful inland town of all Europe.
American and English tourists who have visited the
city all concur in the opinion of von Humboldt.
&ldquo;Prague to a Bohemian,&rdquo; to quote Arthur Symons
(<i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, Sept., 1901), &ldquo;is the epitome of
the history of his country; he sees it as the man sees the
woman he loves, with her first beauty.&rdquo; L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s
<i>Story of Prague</i> will fully repay the reader who would
like to know more of this beautiful medi&aelig;val city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sociology and Economics.</span> The theme of Slavic
immigration to America within the last twenty-five
years has been considered by politicians, settlement
workers, immigration &ldquo;specialists,&rdquo; professional labor
agitators and others. The caption of Alois B. Koukol&rsquo;s
article in <i>The Charities and Commons, A Slav&rsquo;s
a Man for A&rsquo; That</i>, sums up the situation precisely.
Yes, the American Slav is a man, for all that has been
said about him&mdash;chiefly against him&mdash;by professional
labor agitators; but it took the Great War to demonstrate
his utility to America. No economist has written
of him with greater sympathy, understanding and
tact than Emily Greene Balch, teacher at Wellesley
College. To get a more accurate perspective on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">-&nbsp;56&nbsp;-</a></span>
subject, Miss Balch went to the source, to their homelands
to observe <i>Our Slavic Fellow Citizens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokols.</span> The &ldquo;Sokol Union&rdquo; (Sokol in Bohemian
means falcon, a bird typical of strength and fearlessness)
is, or rather was, until the Great War, the most
powerful non-political organization in Bohemia. Suspecting
its members of disloyalty, the authorities in the
first stages of the war, dissolved it. Miroslav Tyr&#353;
and Henry F&uuml;gner founded the &ldquo;Sokol Union&rdquo; in 1862.
Body culture is the primary though not the sole aim of
the society; considered from its ethical aspect the
&ldquo;Sokol Union&rdquo; contemplates nothing less than the
moral and physical regeneration of the Bohemian race.
From Bohemia the Sokol idea has gradually found its
way into other Slav countries, Poland, Russia, Serbia,
Bulgaria and there are Sokols, men and women, even
in America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Travel and Description.</span> The old time travelers
like Christian Frederick Damberger, Georg Robert
Gleig, Johann Georg Keysler, Johann Georg Kohl, described
not the kingdom of the &#268;echs, but Bohemia,
the Province of Austria. After 1621 Bohemia ceased
to exist as an independent state and the veneer of Teutonism
thickened from year to year. So complete
seemed the denationalization of Bohemia in the eighteenth
century and even in the first part of the nineteenth,
that foreigners visiting the baths at Carlsbad
and Marienbad were surprised to hear peasants talk
in an unknown tongue. As for the real Bohemia,
after she had again found herself, no English or American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">-&nbsp;57&nbsp;-</a></span>
traveler has more trenchantly described her castles,
her medi&aelig;val churches, her splendid ruins, her
roads, her industries, her schools, than James Baker.</p>

<p>Two books by travelers of Bohemian nationality
might be mentioned, though, strictly speaking, they
have no place in our Bohemica. They are Dr. Emil
Holub&rsquo;s <i>Seven Years in South Africa; travels, researches,
and hunting adventures between the diamond
fields and the Zambesi</i>, 1872-79, translated by Ellen
Frewer and published in London by Low, Marston,
Searle &amp; Rivington in 1881. The other is B. Kroupa&rsquo;s
<i>An Artist&rsquo;s Tour; gleanings and impressions of travels
in North and Central America and the Sandwich Islands</i>.
With illustrations by the author. Published by
Ward &amp; Downey, London, in 1890.</p>

<p>The opinion has been expressed that John Lederer,
the Virginia traveler, was not an Austrian, as some
surmise, but a Bohemian.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Lederer is by no means an
uncommon surname among Bohemians; moreover,
there is evidence that Bohemian exiles began settling
in Virginia during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</p>

BOHEMIA IN BRITISH STATE PAPERS AND MANUSCRIPTS</h2>

<p>In the compilation of the material here given the
authors have consulted and drawn from the following
sources:</p>

<p><i>Close Rolls</i>, preserved in the Public Record Office;
<i>Calendar of the Patent Rolls</i>; <i>Calendar of entries in
the Papal Registers</i> relating to Great Britain and Ireland;
<i>Letters and Papers Foreign and Domestic of the
reign of Henry VIII.</i>, preserved in the Public Record
Office, the British Museum and elsewhere in England;
<i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, of the reign of successive
English Kings; <i>Rolls of Parliament</i>, comprising the
Petitions, Pleas and Proceedings of Parliament from
A.D. 1278 to A.D. 1503; <i>Journal of the House of
Lords</i>, compiled by the direction of the Lords Committee
for the <i>Journal</i>; <i>Collection of the State Papers
of John Thurloe</i> (Thurlow), Secretary first to the
Council of State, and afterwards to the two Protectors
Oliver and Richard Cromwell, being Authentic Memorials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">-&nbsp;195&nbsp;-</a></span>
of the English Affairs from the Year 1638 to
the Restoration of King Charles II.; <i>Papers relating
to John Drury&rsquo;s Mission to the Continent</i>; <i>Reports of
the British Historical Manuscripts Commission</i>; <i>Reports
of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts</i>.</p>

<p>From the mass of references to Bohemia which one
finds stored in the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, the authors
have practically noted only such as have some
bearing on the relationship between that country and
England.</p>

<p>England&rsquo;s most genuine concern in Bohemia dates
to the first quarter of the seventeenth century, when
Elizabeth Stuart had been called to guide the state
affairs of the ancient Kingdom. &ldquo;Elizabeth Stuart,
Queen of Bohemia&rdquo; occupies a leading place in every
index to the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>.</p>

<p>Certain school histories would make it appear that
it was Austria and Austria alone which combated the
Turkish invasion of southeastern Europe. A perusal
of the reports which English ambassadors sent home
from various posts on the continent, make it clear that
the Bohemian State contributed its full share, in men
and in treasure toward crushing the Turkish menace.
It is well worth recalling in this connection, that the
present Hapsburg monarchy really originated as a result
of a voluntary union entered into in 1526 between
Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. United we stand,
divided we fall before the Turkish peril, was the chief
argument used to effect the union of these three states.</p>

<p>1302, Nov. 10. Westminster. Safe-conduct, until

Southdalton and Northburton, took them and brought
them against their will to High Almain, where they detain
them in captivity, to the king&rsquo;s distress, he requests

all others interested to be favorable and gracious to the
prisoners in those matters wherein they have to do with
them, not seeking occasion against them in respect of

England, John Huss of Bohemia and Jerome of Prague;
Form for examining heretics and suspected heretics, etc.
Calendar of Papal Registers, v. 7, p. 22.</p>

<p>1427, April. Rome. To Henry, Cardinal priest of
St. Eusebius&rsquo;s, papal legate. The Pope has from time
to time sent divers nuncios and legates for the extirpation
of heresy in Bohemia and neighbouring parts, but
without result, nevertheless, he does not lose hope, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">-&nbsp;199&nbsp;-</a></span>
daily prays that the sick flocks may be healed of their
leprosy or be cut off from the land of the living, lest
with their contagion they infect others. As the most
fitting leader of the attack on heresy and the defense
of the church, to convert or do battle with the heretics,
the pope has singled out the cardinal for many reasons,
his wisdom and prudence, as shown formerly (at Constance)
in the matter of the union of the church, his high
lineage, his experience of great affairs, the glory of the
realm and nation, which will make him the more to be
feared in war. The pope has therefore made him legate
a latere throughout all Germany and the realms of
Hungary and Bohemia, and urges him not to refuse to
undertake the burden. The enterprise will bring great
and lasting glory to the King of England; etc. Same,
v. 7, p. 30.</p>

<p>1427, July. Rome. To Henry, Cardinal of England,
legate of the Apostolic see. The Pope rejoiced to receive
his letters dated at Mechlin on the 15 of last month
containing that he had undertaken the office of legate
and is hastening against the Bohemians. Same, v. 7,
p. 34.</p>

<p>1427, Oct. Rome. To Henry, Cardinal of England,
legate of the apostolic see. The pope has with grief
heard, from the legates chancellor, Nicholas Bildeston,
of the disgraceful flight of the army of the faithful in
Bohemia Aug. 2, 1427, from the siege of Meis (St&#345;&iacute;bro)
to Tachau (Tachov) where it was met by the legate,
and from Tachau to the frontier on Aug. 4. He commends
the cardinal for promptly betaking himself to
Bohemia, and for his efforts with the princes and the
army. The cardinal must persevere with his enterprise,
and is to strive in season and out of season with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">-&nbsp;200&nbsp;-</a></span>
princes and prelates of Almain. The clergy and prelates
of Almain, the archbishops of Cologne and Mainz if they
had joined those in Bohemia as they ought, and as had
been arranged, the army would not have retreated with
such disgrace. Same, v. 7, p. 35.</p>

<p>1429. Kingdom of Bohemia destroyed through Infidelity.
Rolls of Parliament, v. 4, p. 335.</p>

<p>1524, Jan. 20. Greenwich. Henry VIII. to Frederick,
John, and George, Dukes of Saxony. His
(Luthers) doctrine is like that of Wycliffe, which, he
doubts not, they abhor, as German Princes and their
progenitors endeavoured to exterminate it, and have confined
it to Bohemia. Feels sure they will prevent it
from flooding Saxony and the whole of Germany. V. 4,
part 1, p. 17.</p>

<p>1527, Jan. 12. Sir John Wallop to Wolsey. It is
thought the King of Bohemia is sending Salamanka to
ask the King of England for aid against the Turk.
Thinks he intends first to make himself King of Hungary.

a gentleman of Moravia, to whom Henry, with his accustomed
liberality has given something in his realm,
fears to be hindered in the enjoyment and receipt of it,
and asks her (Queen of Hungary) to write in his favour;
which both for his virtues and because he is her subject
as dowager of the Kingdom of Bohemia, she cannot
refuse, and therefore begs Henry to give orders to his
officers and subjects therein. V. 19, part 2, p. 37.</p>

<p>1654, July. Leszna, Poland. Peter Figulus (Komensk&yacute;&rsquo;s
son-in-law), to Samuel Hartlib in London. I cannot
but bless the name of the Lord our God, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">-&nbsp;209&nbsp;-</a></span>
I get something from you; for I see evidently, that God
hath chosen you long since to be an instrument in his
hand, as for many other his good works, so likewise
to work a Godly comfort and edification in our souls,
whereof all your letters are full. The public letters
which were sent to you, are subscribed by baron Sadowsky,
brother to him that is in England. They are written
in the name of all our exiled nation, and directed to the
lord protector, his highnes&rsquo;s council, and the parliament.
The baron is a very good soldier, hath served long in
the Swedish wars, longs mightily for some help to the
church of God grievously distressed and afflicted in these
quarters by the Papal and Austrian adherents, being
willing and resolved to spend himself, and do all what
he can to that end.... But he and we all leave the
whole management of this affair to the wisdom of the
lord protector and his council. Perhaps they will thereby
be moved, or occasioned to take into a more serious
deliberation the case of our nation, and of us miserable
exiles.... The emperor seeks nothing but the suppression
of the Gospel, and a dilatation of the Austrian
power. There is a monk lately converted to our religion,
who tells, that the emperor with the pope are
resolved infallibly to make a war against the protestants.
All the cloisters have promised to such a war to contribute
each of them two soldiers and he tells, that they
reckon under the emperors dominions 96,000 cloisters
or monasteries. But now the exacerbation of minds increaseth
by the most grievous persecution in Bohemia,
Moravia, Silesia and Austria. There are thousands of
those, that wait and pray to God for some Zyska, that
would begin a religious war for the protestant cause:
yet none of the princes in Germany have the courage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">-&nbsp;210&nbsp;-</a></span>
to oppose themselves against the house of Austria. B.
Sadowsky is fully persuaded, that God would bless this
enterprise thus seconded, and purely directed to the
glory of God and the relief of the oppressed; especially
if in the meantime the triumphant arms of the Commonwealth
of England permit not the Spaniards to assist
the emperor.... My good Father Mons. Comenius is
once come again out of Hungary to us at Lesna; the
Lord&rsquo;s name be praised for it. (Appended: Greeting in
Latin by Comenius.) Collection of the State Papers of
John Thurloe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to return to the King of Bohemia. He hath
likewise several armies in the field, several friends ans
several generals. The first is the Prince of Anhalte,
the second the Earl of Mansfield, the third the Earl of
Tourne (Thurn); who have under them fifty thousand
men in several quarters, whereby they have so well demanded
themselves, and wherewith so well withstood
their enemies, that the Emperor hath no cause to boast
of his summers work, for his forces hitherto have done
nothing but received loss, and it is very likely that if
the Transilvanian Prince do join once with the King
of Bohemia, they will surely put the Emperor to a sore
plunge, for story doth not acquaint us with such a
formidable division again, and I believe it is a secret
locked up in the treasury of heaven to know or discover

<p>1619. A Proposition made by the States of Bohemia
in theyr Assembly at Prague uppon the Election of a
Kinge the 16th of August, beinge the birthday of the
Prince Elector Palatine. Albeit the nomination of a
Kinge of Bohemia requires a mature councell and deliberacion,
which ought to precede the nomination, it is
an affayre notwithstandinge of the lesse difficultye then
the iejectinge (sic) of a king which gave a beginninge to
this and stands in neede both of a good justification and
of a great power, where (as) the nomination hath of
those aydes but follows of itselfe after the rejection.</p>

<p>Now therefore, since the iejection (sic) as the things
importinge us is already done, the nomination wilbe
much the more easily provided that in the choyse we
stand not presisely upon such a perfection as the world
cannot yeild us. It behoves us also to set apart all
perticuler passions and to have regard only to those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">-&nbsp;232&nbsp;-</a></span>
reasons that are fundamentall, for there are requisite
points so necessary to be considered in the election of
a Kinge that (it) is not for a good patriot to give his
councell for receivinge of one in whome those points
required is not found, but one may with very good assurance
conclude for him in whome they doe dayly more
meete than in any other man.</p>

<p>As in the first place in such a subject it is necessary
that there be none of those thinges to be feard; for if
Kinge Ferdinand was rejected, that is to say, he ought
not eyther to prosecute or advance in the respect of
religion nor exceede in the dependance of his owne counsaylors
or of strangers, but to joine himselfe with the
States he ought not to be opiniative nor given to doe
thinges of his owne head, but to accomadate the customes
of his house and his to the ordinances and liberties of
thys crowne.</p>

<p>In the second place it is required that he affect the
States&rsquo; reputation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that in time both of peace and warr he governe
his Kingdome by his owne presence worthyly and profitably.</p>

<p>Fourthly, that confederates receive no cause of feare
from eyther of danger or damage. Since then there are
few that are inferred into the treaty of eleccion, that is
to say, the Kinge of Denmarke, the Elector Palatine, the
Elector of Saxoni, the Duke of Savoy, and the Prince
of Transilvania, yt will therefore be to purpose to consider
that, although every one of these princes in his owne
perticuler deserveth prayse and commendation, neverthelesse
there is amongst them a certaine diversity which
everyone by himselfe may prudently waigh. And forasmuch
as it is not permitted us to judge liberally of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">-&nbsp;233&nbsp;-</a></span>
great princes in this place, it shall suffice without offence
of any breifely to deduce the reasons for which the
Elector Palatine ought to be esteemed very capable of
the crowne of Bohemia, and fitt to mainteyne the present
estate of the kingdome, for although his highnesse be
not above 23 yeeres of age, he is a prince of great judgement
bred up from his cradle in goodnesse and vertue,
one that hath persons of quality about him as well of
the feild as for the state who are used to curteisy, and
himselfe of very plentifull hopes, and besides at this age
he will better accomodate himselfe to the customes of
the kingdome then if he were more increased in yeares;
and God bestows not wisdome alwayes according to the
age of a man, but to him that calls to God for it in His
feare.</p>

<p>He is a prince moderate, virtuos and resolute in his
actions, quick and sharpe in his discourse, true, courteous
towards all men, very well languaged, holds a very
fayre court of earls, barrons and gentlemen, loves and
cherishes the nobility, imployes in his service even men
of meane condition when he finds meritt in them for it.
He letts no worthy service passe him without his acknowledgement,
he governs his subjects and country (in part
the frontives of this kingdome) with prudence, gives
estimation to men of honor, holds a well ordered councell,
frequents the councell table in his owne person,
takes an exact heed of the opinions and propositions of
his councellors, gives good cause of havinge his judgement
approv&rsquo;d and commended of thinges of importance,
inclines his understandinge willingely to other mens information,
loves the common good and therein takes
paines with zeale and without feare, beares compassion
to the afflicted, shewes himselfe laborious and resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">-&nbsp;234&nbsp;-</a></span>
is beloved of his subjects, beares himselfe peaceably with
his neighbors of what religion soever they be, and winnes
respect of those different beliefs for his owne religion.
He is well affected, yet those who are of another fayth
in his countries doe not find themselves disquieted in
their consciences nor in their exercise of their religion,
so as every man may live freely under him, videlicet,
his conversation be honest and vertous. There is none
can abuse or accuse him of precipitation or opinatives
(sic), a thing worthy remarkeable (sic).</p>

<p>He is in correspondence with those of the house of
Palatine and Bavoirs and, notwithstandinge so, that
cause forsakes nothinge of those rightes nor of the duties
belonginge to the generall estate of the country, and
howsoever that this prince be but younge and shewes
himselfe courteous and sweet towards his people, for
all that there is no lightnesse, dissollutions (sic) nor
voluptuousnesse seene in him nor any disorder nor excesse
in his diett nor any avarice and digality (sic) or
any other thinge whatsoever unbecominge or contrary to
the reputation of a prince. For the assistance the crowne
of Bohemia may expect from him, it may be understoode
of any man that not only he is not in debt, and that
of his revenue he can lay some things upp, but that also
the Kinge of Great Brittaine is his father-in-law, the
Kinge of Denmark is his neere kinsman, and likewise
the Elector of Brandenbourh, the Prince of Orenge his
uncle, the Duke of Bullion his ally, the States of the
United Provinces his confederates, and ancient alliances
with France, the Kinge of Sweden and the Hanse
Townes his friends, and for his correspondents the Duke
of Savoi, Venice and Switzerland. He is a good credit
with all the Princes Electors and other princes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">-&nbsp;235&nbsp;-</a></span>
Estates of the Empire, more perticulerly with those of
the Union he hath confederacies, the Prince of Transsilvania
and High Hungary doe beare affection to him,
Saxonie and Bavoir are in good termes with him, Mentz
and the neighbouring countries looke uppon him with
honor and respect, insomuch as the crowne of Bohemia
by this only meanes may procure the amity of all those
which we doe now labour for with so much paine and
travell, and by the same meanes may be conserved and
fortified against our enimies, which cannot of any other
nominated in the election be eyther expected or hoped
for. And since it is a certainty that this prince would
not accept of the election for Ambition sake, but only
for the common good, we may therefore promise ourselves
that he will alwayes continue in the good affection
he hath already shewed to this crowne by the profitable
counsell and assistances which as well as his owne person
as other wayes according to the occasions he hath made
to appeare, where (as) there are some others that for
for theyr perticuler conservations have greatly prejudiced
not only the estates of the kingdome of Bohemia but the
countries also and provinces confederats.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the sayd confederated provinces are to consider
whoe are already in good understandinge with this
prince, that they cannot have the like confidence in others
who are to much tyed in the respect of the house of
Austria to succour the sayd provinces in theyr neede,
and in such a case the confederations would bring them
prejudice rather than benefitt, a point of great waight
touchinge this crowne as may be seene by experience.</p>

<p>Since then that all these qualities required doe meete
in the person of the Prince Elector, and that in those
of the others treated in the election (the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">-&nbsp;236&nbsp;-</a></span>
Transilvania excepted, who hath his eye upon another
marke) there are many imperfections to be found, as
may easily be shewed, it is therefore a matter to no
purpose longer to defer the election, and so much the
rather because the crowne of Bohemia with the countries
confederate will now after the rejection be more
disquieted than ever; and remayning without a head we
shall find none whoe will duly undertake our protection
or defence. V. 7, p. 269.</p>

<p>1619. The joyfull receivinge, triumphant entronce
and stately formall coronation of Fredericke, the Prince
Elector Palatine, and the Lady Elizabeth, Princesse
Electoresse, King and Queen of Bohemia, on Munday
and Thursday the 25th and 28th day of October ould
stile, 1619.</p>

<p>It is knowne unto all men for what weightie reasons
the States of the kingdome of Bohemia and of the incorporated
countries have with one joynte consent excluded
Kinge Ferdinand from the kingedome, and have
in his place, with an especially mutuall agreement, chosen
and named for theire kinge the right highe and mightie
Prince Fredricke by the grace of God Erle Palatine of
the Rhyne, Duke of both the Bavaries, Prince Elector
and Vicar of the Romane Empire, whome after a lawfull
callinge they have crowned on the 4th and 7th dayes
of November, newe stile, that is, the 25th and 28th of
October, ould stile, 1619.</p>

<p>Uppon the 21-31 of October, 1619, afternoone, came
his Majestie with the Queene his wife, the younger
prince theire eldest sonne, his Lord brother Duke Lodowicke,
the Duke of Wertemberge, the 2 Princes of
Anhalt, together with his whole retinue, consistinge of
five companies of curast horsemen, 500 harquebus horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">-&nbsp;237&nbsp;-</a></span>men,
and 3 auncients of footemen of 300 a peece, with
many coatches and a very greate number of wagons
laden with the carriages towards Prague, and beinge
come within 2 or 3 Englishe miles there of into a faire
pleasant place be a parke called the Starre, where the
Lords, the States of the kingdome of Bohemia and of
the incorporated countryes of Moravia, Silesia and both
of Lusati&aelig;s, with the magistrates and chiefe men of
the 3 citties of Prague, attended his Majesties cominge,
accompanied with about a 1000 horse, very statelie and
well appointed; there the(y) alighted and received him
out of his coatche with greate state, honor and reverence,
unto whome the Baron of Tallenberge, Lord
Greate Chamberlaine, made a speech in the Bohemian
tongue, which the Barron of Ruppa interpreted in
Dutche; his Majestie gave thereunto so good an answere
as that the States much rejoyced thereat, which done,
they came one after another, kneeled downe and kissed
his Majesties hand. In like respect every way was the
Queene received, save that they kneeled not unto her.</p>

<p>Then his Majestie mounted on horsebacke, but yett
stayed a whyle, till the lords and gentry were also
mounted and that theire Coronell Kinski had orderly
marshall&rsquo;d them, whose discipline his Majestie well liked.
Then the(y) marched on conductinge his Majestie towerds
Prague; when he came into the cittie, the citizens
of the 3 citties of Prague stoode in armes, very bravely
appointed, as well on horsebacke as on foote on both
sides of the street and open places, makeinge a lane or
courte or guarde frome the entringe in of the cittie unto
the castle; theire Majesties rid alonge, and that in this
manner.</p>

<p>They of the little cittie were one cornett of horse with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">-&nbsp;238&nbsp;-</a></span>
6 trumpetts and one kettledrumme, they of the newe
cittie one cornett of horse with 6 trumpetts and one
kettledrumme, they of the ould cittie one cornett of
horse with 6 trumpetts and one kettledrumme, as also
another companie of 200 horse voluntary well-willers,
and 7 companies of foote, all citizens, exceedingly well
mounted and furnished.</p>

<p>And when his Majestie came nere unto the newe forte
and bullwarke before the castle, whereon stood a companie
on foote with a displayed ancient, there were standinge
400 boures or husband and laboringe countrymen
representinge the communalty and 4th state or parte
of the land, all armed accordinge to the ould and auncient
custome and manner of their country, videlicet, they had
an ould weatherbeaten ancient wherein was painted the
name Ziseha (sic),<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> theire auncient captaine or generall
and deliverer, with a challice, and the hoste or signe of
a wafer, eache theire armes of the ould fashion, a hevy
brestplate, a massie headepeece to assault and scale
with all, wooden clubes set with iron spikes, iron flayles
of threshalle, crosbowes, great iron sheildes, with 2-handed
swords, and stood in battaile array as Lizeha
(sic) had in his time appointed them. When his
Majestie came unto them he stayed a while and was
by theire captaine entertained and welcommed with a
Lattine ovation, who did greatlie congratulate his Majesties
comeinge, and havinge concluded, the multitude
began to cry out, Vivat, vivat Rex Fredericus! and so
ran together to route on a heape one amongst another,
makinge such a greate noyse with theire armes as that
his Majestie tooke greate pleasure thereat and could not
forbeare laughter. Before his Majestie there marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">-&nbsp;239&nbsp;-</a></span>
400 horsemen under theire Coronell Kinsby (sic), representinge
the knightehood and gentry of the land, who
had 8 silver trumpetts and 4 other trumpetts with 8
cettledrummes; theire cornett was of blew damaske
whereon were the Prince Elector Palatine&rsquo;s armes richly
imbrodered; the Lords Derectors and States of the land
followed after bravelie mounted; after them rid the
Duke of Mansterberge (sic) of Silesia, haveinge on his
right hand the Duke of Wertemberge and on the left
hand the younge Prince of Anhalt. Then rid his Majestie&rsquo;s
Lord brother Lodowicke with ould Prince Dhinstion
(Christian) of Anhalt, after whome imediatelie followed
his kinglie Majestie on a blacke greate horse
covered with a blacke footeclothe all over imbrodered
with silver. Then followed the Queene ridinge in a
exceeding rich coatch, like the whereof had never beene
seene afore in Prague, and by her sate the younge Prince
her sonne; after her Majestie came 2 other coatches
wherein were the wives and daughters of divers princes
and earles, after which followed sundry other coatches
with many gentlewoemen, maides of honor and others,
and after these came lastly the Prince Electors owne
coronell and harquebus horsemen and footemen in good
order, the horsemen well mounted, all statelie deckt with
brave attire, faire liveries and gallant scarfes of blewe,
the King&rsquo;s colours.</p>

<p>This ridinge through the cittie lasted 3 houres longe,
and was beheld of many thousands of people to theire
greate admiracion; his Majestie tooke therein greate
pleasure and did oftentimes put off his hatt, and with
a chearefull countenance bowe himselfe towerds the
people, as did also the Queene both chearefully and with
greate majestie. When they were come within the castle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">-&nbsp;240&nbsp;-</a></span>
court there the(y) sawe a man sittinge above uppon
the churche with an auncient in his hand and waveing
it over his heade, and then another man sittinge uppon
the rounde ball on the steeple toppe, who played a
longe time uppon a kettledrumme.</p>

<p>In the castle court theire Majesties alighted nere unto
the longe hall and went towerds the greene chamber,
where there stoode a great number of Bohemian laydes
and gentlewoemen of good rancke richly attired, who
received her Majestie with greate reverence, and so
attended on her into her lodgings. All things were accomplished
with such state, honor, and good successe
as the like was never yett done unto any Romane Emperor;
all which shall shortlie be cutt in brasse, and
made publicke unto the viewe of the worlde.</p>

<p>Here followeth the King&rsquo;s coronacion.</p>

4th of Novemb. newe stile, that is the 25 of October.
ould stile in the manner as followeth.</p>

<p>First after the lords, the States, had attended his
Majestie into the castle churche and brought him into
St. Wentzeslawes chappell, there they putt uppon his
Majestie the regall robe, which was a longe white sattine
or damaske gowne all over imbroidered with goulde;
before went 40 preists, singeinge men and querresters
in white surplices, then behinde them 7 other more
principall preists in blewishe or violett cloakes with rich
taffitie hatts of the same collor; after them followed the
officers of the kingedome carryinge the jewells and ensignes
belongeing to the coronation, as namely, the
hereditary Archbutler of the kingedome of Bohemia with
a gilded silver tunne, the hereditarie Archcupberer with

of the land with the scepter, the Lord Chiefe Justice
of the kingedome with the regall ball, the Archburkgrave
with the crowne, bearinge it in bothe his hands;
after went the Heralde of the kingedome Bohemia in
his coate of armes with a white staffe in his hand, then
the hereditarie Lord High Marshall of the crowne of
Bohemia with the regall electorall sworde in a red velvett
sheathe, after whome immediatelie followed his
Majestie bareheaded, havinge on the right hand the Lord
Administrator of the Bohemian Protestant Colledge and
on his left side another Bohemian preacher (who afterwards
made the sermon), both of them attyred in blacke
velvett gownes. These 2 brought his Majestie unto the
alter, where they kneeled downe with him and prayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">-&nbsp;242&nbsp;-</a></span>
a while, and then goeinge backe from the alter, they sett
his Majestie in a faire chaire of hayre-colored vellvett,
who returneinge to the alter, the Lord Administrator
began to act and reade aloude certaine statutes of Lattine,
which done, the trumpetts sounded a greate noise;
after was begun to be sunge in Lattine Veni Sancte
Spiritus, and thereuppon in the Bohemian tongue God
the Father dwell us by was also sunge, a collect reade,
and the preacher putt on his white surplice, went up into
the pulpitt to preach in the Bohemian speech. After he
had propounded the matter he was to treate of, and
prayed, he stayed there till the people had sunge the
20th Psalme also in the Bohemian language; then he went
on with his sermon, and yet in the meanewhile, betweene
the partes thereof, were 3 severall times Bohemian hymnes
sunge; the sermon beinge ended the foresaid Lord Administrator
went againe to the alter and did there in
Lattine singe the Letany, which done, the trumpetts and
musicke made a marveilous sweete melodie, which done,
a chapter out of the Apostle Paule to Timothy was
reade before the altar, and 2 Bohemian himnes sunge;
this ended, the Lord Administrator, with the preacher,
the Lord Chief Burgrave, the Lord High Steward and
Lord Greate Chamberlaine of the land, attended his
Majestie to the alter, where they all kneeled downe and
prayed againe. Then they stoode up and, haveinge
spoken unto his Majestie concerninge the accustomed
oathe he was to take, the Lord Chiefe Burgrave spake
thrice alone unto the people to this effect: &ldquo;Seeing we
are nowe aboute to crowne his Majestie, it is thought
meete againe to admonishe you joyntlie to tell us freelie,
whether it be your wills that we shall proceede on forwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">-&nbsp;243&nbsp;-</a></span>
and crowne his Majestie?&rdquo; Whereupon the people
with a full and jointe consent cryed out amaine and
said everie time, &ldquo;We will.&rdquo; Then the Lord Cheife
Burgrave held a booke unto his Majestie, whereon his
Majestie haveing laide his 2 fingers, the Lord Cheife
Burgrave reade the accustomed oathe unto him in the
Bohemian tongue, which his Majestie performed unto
the Lords the States repeatinge every word of it after
the Lord Chief Burgrave. Then his Majestie kneeled
downe before the altar, where the Lord Administrator
stoode before him, holdinge on the booke a gilded box,
wherein was oyle, of which he tooke a little with one
finger and anointed therewith his Majestie&rsquo;s foreheade,
strekeinge it in forme of a crosse. This beinge done,
the Lord High Marshall delivered the sword into the
hands of the Lord Administrator, who took it and
presentlie gave it to his Majestie, sayinge these wordes:
Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Amen.</p>

<p>After this he delivered unto him, first the scepter, then
the regall ball, put a red velvett cap upon his heade, and
the lord Administrator takeinge up the crowne in his
hands, whereon the Lord Chiefe Burgrave, the Lord
Highe Steward of the land, the Lord Great Chamberlaine
of the land, and the other preist or minister tooke
holde, and so joyntly sett the crowne uppon his Majesties
head in the name of the Holy and Blessed Indivisible
Trinitie, and then (he) was by them all lifted up, attended
to his chaire and sett therein with the crowne
upon his heade and the ball and scepter in his hands.
Now when all this was done the Lord Cheife Burgrave
said unto the Lords the States: &ldquo;My Lords, seeinge
our gracious Kinge is already crowned, so are we nowe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">-&nbsp;244&nbsp;-</a></span>
accordinge unto our custome to sweare allegeance unto
him and to the crowne and acknowledge him for our
gracious Kinge and lord.&rdquo; Hereupon the Lord Cheife
Burgrave kissed the regall ball, his Majestie&rsquo;s right hand,
touched the crowne with his 2 fingers, bowed himself
before his Majestie, and so went aside, giveinge way.
About an 100 persons did all the like. After this did the
Lord Administratour with a loude voyce singe Te Deum
laudamus. This followed the whole musicke, cornetts,
saggebutts, trumpetts, kettledrummes; the bells in all
three citties of Prague did ringe, 28 peeces of great
ordinance made readie for the purpose were discharged,
and the citizens and souldiers of the cittie, beinge 13
companies of foote and sundry cornetts of horse, discharged
all theire ouer (sic).</p>

<p>After that his Majestie had (sittinge in his coronation
chaire) knighted 5 lords and 3 gentlemen, he rose
and went thence attended with all the lords others to
the records of the land, where also accordinge to auncient
use and custome he sware to preserve and mainetaine
them and subscribed unto all he was to subscribe
unto. Where as his Majestie went and returned there
were divers sorts of coynes of gould and silver throwne
amongst the people, one of which had on the one side
this inscription, God and theire (sic) cuntryes have given
unto me this crowne, and on the other side were five
hands houldinge on a crowne, signifying the kingedome
of Bohemia and the 4 incorporated cuntries. All alonge
the streetes, and within the castle whereupon his
Majestie rid and went to the records of the land, there
was broade clothe spreade on the ground, which at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">-&nbsp;245&nbsp;-</a></span>
comeing backe was all given for larges and made prizd
unto the people. At his comeinge backe into the castle
dinner was made ready, where was one table of state
prepared, whereat his Majestie sate in his regall robes
with the crowne on his heade, and the Queene with him.
There were other tables besides furnished as whereat

About the midst of dinner his Majestie, the crowne to
be taken off, stoode up and dranke into the health of all
the 3 states and Bohemia, and caused it to be drunke
round aboute hall. In the interim betweene his Majestie&rsquo;s
coronacion and the Queene&rsquo;s, his Majestie first
confirmed all the officers and governours of the kingedome
in theire offices and governmentes, commanndinge
justice and government to goe on in the ordinarie due
course as was meete and requisite. Then next perceivinge
that the stewes and brothelhouses were there still
in use and tollerated, and had theire house within the
bulwarke round aboute the cittie, and withall a world
of poore and needy people as well of able bodyes as
aged, sicke and impotent, lyinge and standinge in the
streets to the great dishonor of God and of religion,
his Majestie both put downe the stewes presentlie and
commannded an hospitall and house of correccion to be
forthwith builded; that so theis aged, sicke and impotent

<p>NOTES.</p>
</div>

<p>Once Protestant, Bohemia at present is overwhelmingly
Catholic. In 1890 the Catholics numbered 96.17 per cent,
the Protestants 2.22 per cent and the Jews 1.56 per cent.
It must be borne in mind, however, that prior to 1781, in
which year the &ldquo;Patent of Toleration&rdquo; was issued, no
other church was tolerated outside the Catholic.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>Bohemia may be said to be a country of farmers, judging
from the number of persons engaged in agricultural
pursuits. Out of every one thousand people 408.7 per cent
are engaged in the cultivation of soil and forestry; 352.6
per cent find employment in manufacturing and mining,
59.5 per cent in commerce, railroading, etc., and 87.8 per
cent earn their living as laborers.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>Illiteracy in Bohemia is rapidly disappearing. According
to the general census of 1890 the ratio of adults unable
to read and write is 19.69 per cent, which compares favorably
with that of the most advanced of European nations.
Figures compiled in 1881 show the ratio of illiteracy to be
in England, 16 per cent; Scotland, 12; Ireland, 33; France,
22;  Germany, 6; Russia, 89; Austria 51 (education is especially
backward in Hungary and Transylvania); Italy, 59;
Spain and Portugal, 66; Switzerland, 12, Belgium and
Holland, 14; Scandinavia, 13.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>Curiously enough, the natives do not call their country
&ldquo;Bohemia,&rdquo; but <i>Cechy</i>, nor themselves &ldquo;Bohemians,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;Cechs,&rdquo; pron. &ldquo;Chekhs&rdquo; or &ldquo;Czechs.&rdquo; Tradition has it
that the leader&rsquo;s name who conducted the first Slav tribe
to Bohemia was Cech, hence the race name. The Latin
chroniclers of the Middle Ages were altogether ignorant
of this, and persisted in calling the people who bore it
Bohemians, and thus the Slavs of Bohemia inherited the
name of the Boii (Germanic race) whom they had displaced.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>Superintendent of the Census Bureau, Mr. Porter, would
hardly sanction the method adopted by the Austrian government
in determining the nationality of a people. In
Bohemia the <i>language</i> spoken is the test. Americans or
Irishmen would, therefore, in Austria, be classed as &ldquo;English,&rdquo;
because they speak that language. This ingenious
method is highly &ldquo;useful,&rdquo; especially in the present conflict
of races, for it helps to bolster up the minority in the
land, deceiving many as to the actual strength of the
Chekhs, thousands of whom use the German language in
business and social relations. Accepting the language as
a test, 62.79 per cent were found in 1890 in Bohemia to
&ldquo;use&rdquo; the Bohemian and 37.19 per cent the German tongue.</p>

<p>Austria is a perfect mosaic of races. This diversity is
best exemplified in the complexion of the schools, where
all the dominant languages of the monarchy clamor for
recognition. There are universities at Vienna, Prague,
Gratz, Innsbruck, Cernovice, Cracow, Lwow, Buda-Pesth,
Kolosvar and Zagreb. The universities in Vienna, Gratz,
Innsbruck and Cernovice teach in German; the Prague in
Chekh; that of Lwow in Polish and Ruthenian; that of
Cracow in Polish; those of Buda-Pesth and Kolosvar in
Magyar; that of Zagreb in Croatian.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>An Englishman traveling through Bohemia thus describes
the people in the <i>Illustrated News</i>: &ldquo;As for the
people there was not a sign of the dreamy sadness and
strange mysticism of the Slav that one is forever reading
about. They worked with a dogged energy and commonplace
industry that would not have been out of the way in
Zola&rsquo;s peasants. In no other country is it so impossible
to remain unconscious of the surplus population question
and the hopelessness of the peasant&rsquo;s fate. In Germany,
or during our rides in France, in Italy, in England
we sometimes had the road to ourselves; in Bohemia,
never. There was always someone just behind us or in
front of us.&rdquo; This latter statement about the density of
population will be understood when we remember that
but 4&frac12; per cent. of all the land in Bohemia is not under
cultivation.</p>

<p class="center ltrspc"><sup class="astsk">*</sup> <sub>*</sub> <sup class="astsk">*</sup></p>

<p>Like Ireland Bohemia is governed by a lieutenant governor
appointed by the sovereign. The highest legislative
power in the land is the diet convoking in Prague and
composed of 242 members elected by the people. One
archbishop, three bishops and two university rectors,
however, hold their seats by virtue of office. As may be
imagined the power the diet exercises is very limited, the
deliberations depending on the pleasure or displeasure of
the emperor, who selects the presiding officer. The latter
is styled as the &ldquo;marshal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;high marshal.&rdquo; The diet
has the prerogative of electing a standing committee of
eight members known as the &ldquo;land committee&rdquo; (zemsky
vybor) and over this committee again the marshal presides.
For political and administrative purposes the
country is divided into circles, the circles are sub-divided
into captaincies. The two crownlands, Moravia and
Silesia, have each 100 and 31 deputies in their home diets,
respectively. The government officials, though great
reforms have taken place of late, are far from popular.
This is especially the case with the military captains, for
whom the people conceive as much liking as the Italians
had for Radetzky and Pachta. Insufferably stiff, cold,
repellent and severe, they were regarded by the people as
the source of all their woes.</p>

<p class="center lgfont"><i>Masaryk and His Work</i></p>
</div>

<p>A patriot desires but one reward: that he
should live to see his labors bear fruit. On
January 12, 1917, thousands of Czechs in
the United States found time in the midst
of their joyous celebration of the dawn of
Bohemia&rsquo;s independence to remember the
grand old man of Bohemia, Thomas Garigue
Masaryk. He it was who put the ancient
kingdom of Bohemia once more upon
the map of Europe. On the day when the
Allies&rsquo; answer to President Wilson was published,
he surely was happy, for he had
proof that his titanic labors, his tremendous
personal and family sacrifices were not
made in vain. Bohemia&rsquo;s right to independence
was clearly recognized by the Allies
and the liberation of the country from foreign
domination was made one of the conditions
of peace.</p>

<p>For centuries no one in Bohemia did more
than dream of independence. This Slav
country had been subject to the Hapsburgs
for so many generations and so thoroughly
was it repressed that even the boldest spirits
among its leaders regretfully put aside all
thoughts of absolute freedom as visionary
and aimed merely at securing for the lands
of the Bohemian crown the widest possible
autonomy within the confines of the Austrian
Empire. On several occasions during
the long reign of Francis Joseph the Czechs
came near to the realization of these moderate
ambitions, but always the emperor
drew back unable to give up his ambition
to be the German ruler of German or Germanized
subjects.</p>

<p>Of late years the struggle of the Czechs
for a certain amount of liberty at home and
for the right to participate in the government
of the Empire was growing more and
more hopeless. The general European situation
was undergoing a change greatly to
the disadvantage of Bohemia. The Hapsburg
realm was losing its standing as a
great power, due mainly to the constant internal
dissensions and language disputes,
while the truly national states of Europe
were growing in population, wealth and
military power. Above all Germany, excelling
in industrial and military preparedness,
aggressive and domineering, was looking
for new worlds to conquer. America was
out of the question, for the United States
was guarding jealously against the invasion
of the two western continents through its
Monroe doctrine. Germany&rsquo;s African colonies
were unsuitable for colonization by
white men and constituted merely a financial
burden. Only Asia offered an undeveloped
field&mdash;the ramshackle Turkish Empire&mdash;and
to that land of promise the road
from Germany led through the dual empire
and the Balkan states. Prague was the
first stage on the Berlin-Bagdad highway,
and the Czech people were the first obstacle
to German expansion. It was a part of Germany&rsquo;s
plan to reduce Austria to complete
subserviency by the exaltation of its German
minority and a more thorough repression
of the Slav and Latin races, with the assistance
of the Magyars.</p>

<p>There were not lacking statemen in Bohemia
who saw whither things were tending.
Two of them stand out above the other
Czech patriots: Dr. Charles Kramar and
Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. Kramar,
the leader of the Young Czech party, for
years representative of the middle class of
Bohemia, yielded to no one in his devotion
to the race from which he sprang or in the
sincerity of his intentions to serve the Czech
people to the best of his great ability. But
being a wealthy manufacturer, a &ldquo;practical&rdquo;
man, intent upon gaining results in the
Vienna parliament, he failed to draw the
only conclusion necessitated by the changed
European situation which he so well understood.
He realized that Germany was
&ldquo;peacefully penetrating&rdquo; the Danube monarchy,
that the very existence of the Czech
nation was imperiled; on the floor of the
parliament and in the Austrian delegation</p>
